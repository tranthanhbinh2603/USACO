1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,800
Remember the assignment operator, if I have a class A and A Class B and I said it equal be, then there

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,950
is a member by member Cobbe that happened from the first class to the second class.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,630
We said before that this is very risky if we have a pointer, because it's going to be a pointer from

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,450
the second quarter to the first pointer.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,510
And now two objects are looking to the pointer and they are going to destroy it.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,780
We learned the cubicle structure and we learned how the copy constructor can help us to protect us from

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,070
that.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,980
So we define the before here, like, here's some class that has some value and we are deleting the

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,060
value in that structure.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,370
And then we are providing constructor.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,230
If you want to copy it, then we are copying by ourself with the value not taking the pointer.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Now we also say that you provide the structure for this case.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,720
The missing case here is that we also have to provide assignment operator, because if someone say equal

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,490
B is again going to take his own copy of the pointer to our own copy to the pointer.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,310
That's why we have to provide an assignment.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,190
Operator The logic of the assignment operator is following.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,630
You provide operator equal and then you provide an object to make an assignment for me.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,240
And then you have here a return on time of your b, b, b, b difference.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,380
Now implementing the assignment operator is tricky.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
There are three steps that you have to keep in mind.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,540
Remember, the first step is do not assign the variable to itself.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,050
Do not assign a variable to.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,370
So if someone did equal a you don't.

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:32,950
You don't.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,110
You don't have to go and do all of the member values could be best.

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,860
This can be very problematic.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,880
So the way is we first double check if this another object is the same as our class, if say we just

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,590
return, we do not have to do anything else.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,770
The second tricky thing is ability class, if the middle class has already some logic, has some assignment

30
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,010
operator, then it's much better to even just call the operator equal function of the base class.

31
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,060
Once you're done with that, then go ahead with your step by step.

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,760
Member function could be based on values and just switch them to your internal class.

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:18,040
This way you are simply overloading the operator in case you would like to prevent the operator equal.

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,340
Like you can also prevent the constructor you do in the following.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,460
You say here operator equal, equal, delete, equal delete prevented someone from assigning it.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,180
Remember this is a B to equal B one.

37
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,440
Here is a copy constructor because we are creating an object, but here we are assigning.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,240
So again, if you have a pointer inside your class that you have created, you have to do three things.

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,440
You have to destroy it.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,950
You have to constructor, you have to operator assignment.

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,590
You have to do this three steps in order.

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,910
That said.
