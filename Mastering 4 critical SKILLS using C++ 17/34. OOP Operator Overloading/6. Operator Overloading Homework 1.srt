1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,270
In decision, we will meet our first homework interpreter overloading the first one is about adding

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:06,850
to victors.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,390
We know that we can define two victories in C++.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,770
We do.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,360
We can compare them, but we can't add them together.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,290
I would like you to provide the adding operator that takes two vectors and add them together.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,940
Specifically, add the smallest one to the largest one in order.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,900
So if you have these two arrays, it's going to add the 10 to the one and 20 to the two, and then the

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,340
three and four would be as this.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,020
So are now extending the functionality of something that is in our class.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,110
In a similar way, the multiplication, I would like to introduce the multiplication function to the

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,230
string class already.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,830
So if you have something like that here that times the three would repeat the word about three times.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,020
So extend the C++ string class to support the multiplication operator ordering beers for our beer class.

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:02,770
I would like you to support an operator less than as a as a member function in the code to allow such

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,090
such operator also override the print function in the class to bring to the new to bring to the workless.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,940
Sorry, the debate was already defined, just the rhetoric is that in the order of debates, you are

18
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,800
going to define a new class name, the name debate is going to inherit from the previous class.

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,640
So now it has one new barometer, the way you are going to define or brutalisation.

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,290
But be careful.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,470
I don't want you to duplicate any efforts first to utilize the Berent operator Lisanne to make a comparison

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,220
as much as you could, then just talk to them.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,440
You need to go right now the brain to function to be able to bring to the added animals that it.
