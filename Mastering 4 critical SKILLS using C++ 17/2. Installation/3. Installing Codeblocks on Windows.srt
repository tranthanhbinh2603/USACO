In this video, we will learn how to install "CodeBlocks" on Windows.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,900
Installing "CodeBlocks" is an easy experience most of the time, however, it is very impractical
2

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,340
for me to support all 'OSs' and their different versions.
3

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
Check out the approach here.
4

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,090
If it isn't your version or doesn't work, just google your version.
5

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,130
Sadly, from OS to another, and even within the same OS setup, you may face different 
6

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,520
errors.
7

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,360
The good news, typically googling for the problems will end up with a solution, especially on a "StackOverFlow"
8

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,970
website.
9

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:44,440
The first step is to just google with word "codeblocks", it typically should show you some page, looks
10

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,450
like this one, click on "Downloads",
11

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,020
then you will find "Download the binary release", just click it. In the download binary release,
12

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,930
you should find different Windows versions, the one that you should select is the one with that "mingw.exe",
13

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,820
this one has all that you need. If you are 64bit,
14

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,810
you just select "mingw" here. If you are 32bit, you just select "mingw-32bit" here. Download and just proceed normally.
15

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,870
There are more links here for Linux and Mac, but you don't need to interact with them.
16

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,540
One critical step is we need to add the path of the "MinGW" to the system environment.
17

18
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,760
So the way to do that, this is a bit standard step.
18

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,640
Just go to your environment here and click "env".
19

20
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,470
If you are into Windows 10, then there are more links here.
20

21
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,230
The path that we are interested to add to the environment path is the path of the "MinGW\bin",
21

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,090
so it should be like this path.
22

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,570
But if it isn't, validate where is the path exactly
23

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:58,300
First. If you click on the edit, you go and search for "env" and then it shows you such a "System
24

25
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,090
Properties", click "Advanced" then "Environment Variables",
25

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,180
proceed more, you should find a variable named "Path".
26

27
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,000
Edit this path and keep going.
27

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,680
You should find a lot of paths here.
28

29
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:18,550
Just click "New" and add a new one, the one as we said the "MinGW Path" and click "OK" and "Save". If it happens
29

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,570
that you have problems,
30

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,660
first, double check that the path you added is really here.
31

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,310
You didn't do any mistakes like canceling or so, the second is just restart your whole machine.
32

33
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,430
Probably nothing more is needed for such step.
33

34
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,540
That is it. :)
