00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,050
In this video, we will learn how to create a project in Eclipse. As you see, there are many menus 
1

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,360
here.
2

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,340
You are encouraged to explore all of them.
3

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,850
On the left side, you have the Project Explorer.
4

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,560
This is where you have a workspace.
5

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,010
A workspace is just an area with a bunch of projects for you.
6

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,260
You start from this top menu or from here and right-click,
7

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,960
"New" and then say "C++ Project" or "C++ manage a project", give it a project name.
8

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,780
Remember that the workspace's path in Eclipse
9

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,630
should have no spaces at all.
10

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,400
And also the project name should have no spaces at all.
11

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,260
This reduces a lot of problems.
12

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,820
Select here "Hello World C++ Project" and either one of these guys. If you are Windows then you select 
13

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,680
also "MinGW".
14

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,470
You click next and make sure the source is empty, and next, and click "Advanced Settings", this is an important 
15

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,800
choice here.
16

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,090
You go to "C++ Building", "Behavior" tab and mark "Auto Build". The Auto Build choice is going to make your 
17

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,080
life much easier.
18

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,190
Clicking Finish, you have now here your own code and then let's run it.
19

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,480
If you would like to run it, you right-click 
20

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,340
here and say "Run As" then "C C++ application".
21

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,970
Then it's going to print "!!!Hello World!!!".
22

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,200
Remember that in any C++ project you have to do two things to run,
23

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,800
you have to compile and you have to run it. As we are making it auto build,
24

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
we usually don't have to compile it,
25

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,040
we just have to just run it.
26

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,620
The first way to run it is as we did here to right-click
27

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,080
and "Run as" and just go ahead.
28

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,290
Also, you can just click here in this run test, run this button.
29

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,100
If you have many projects, then you can click on this item and just click one of them.
30

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,710
You can also find it here from the run menu, so all of them have the same thing.
31

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,440
In the future, you can go here and run as "Run Configuration".
32

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,240
You will find your own project here, among other projects, and you will find other tips that are
33

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,820
important to explore in the far future.
34

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:16,860
Going back to our project, maybe the next thing to do is..., by the way, I think there is also
35

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,140
[ctrl-F11] here as a shortcut.
36

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,370
So if we did [ctrl-F11], it just also going to (Build and Run) for us.
37

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,410
Let's create a problem.
38

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,090
Let's remove this semicolon here.
39

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:36,330
Then you either use [ctrl-S] to save the file, or there is this "Save" single-button, or there is this "Save All" for
40

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,020
all opened files.
41

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,930
So let's just save whatever way. You would notice that there is, here in the console area,
42

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,310
there is "expected ';' ".
43

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,780
So there is a problem here missing.
44

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,840
Also, if you go to the tab "problems", you start to see it here.
45

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,690
So this is how you know that there is something wrong, mainly through the console part.
46

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,990
what else to try here?
47

48
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,430
Let's open this test project.
48

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,130
You would find here the "Test.cpp" and the "Binaries',
49

50
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,320
The "Binaries" is referring to the executable, which is ".exe" on windows.
50

51
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,870
Let's do something interesting here.
51

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,260
Let's click on the "Debug" folder, get "Properties" and "Resource" here, then let's get this directory
52

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,570
and try to go and print it.
53

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,710
So here we can go to that guy.
54

55
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,920
You can find here the "Test executable" and the "Test.o". Every time you change your code and
55

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,870
save it and build, these two files are going to be replaced with new files.
56

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,030
If it happened for some reason, for example, that this executable is opened in a way and the program
57

58
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,920
failed to replace it, you are going to face a problem. It is just cannot replace the 
58

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,280
file.
59

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,930
What else might be useful here?
60

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,670
In this menu here,
61

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,820
if you have several programs running, you can see them. Later,
62

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,710
we will run several programs together.
63

64
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,640
You would notice that there is a red-button here indicating that the program is actually running.
64

65
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,900
If you run two programs at the same time, you will get an error, as I said, something like,
65

66
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,020
"permission denied" because it cannot run the program.
66

67
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,230
shortcuts.
67

68
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:29,850
If you press [ctrl-shift-L], it is going to show you the list of shortcuts in Eclipse.
68

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,940
I advise you to be very clever in this shortcut list.
69

70
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,970
But for now, the shortcut that I have interest to teach you is what we call the "Formatter".
70

71
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:45,170
Let's say I'm going to corrupt the shape of this code this way, like here...
71

72
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,970
Typically, young guys write in a bit unorganized way.
72

73
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,800
If you started to press [ctrl-shift-F], it is going to return it back in an organized way.
73

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,530
So this is a shortcut that we are using all the time.
74

75
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,580
Other than that, there is the menu of choices that you have.
75

76
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,470
One of the..., you can clean the project
76

77
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,020
if there is something wrong. Refresh it to refer to some file, close it, or close other projects and
77

78
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,410
so on.
78

79
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:22,810
One of the very lovely features here is the "compare and restore" features. If you would like to, if in the future,
79

80
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,500
you have an updated version and thought, "I would like to come back to a previous version of the code",
80

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,840
you can right-click and "compare as" with "local history" and it is going to show you a bunch
81

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,700
of your old history changes.
82

83
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,760
And this is very useful in many cases.
83

84
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,540
The last thing I would like to highlight here is creating a new file. Let's create a new file and
84

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,180
let's call it maybe..., "source file" here,
85

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,710
"HELLO.CPP"
86

87
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,830
here, and click it here.
87

88
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,740
Now, it is an empty file.
88

89
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,350
Let's copy this file to it here,
89

90
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:06,690
and let's save. What is going to happen here, we will have a problem. The reason behind having the problem
90

91
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,040
here is as following,
91

92
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,690
OK, I used a wrong name file.
92

93
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,960
It should be "cpp"small.
93

94
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,140
Got a bug anyway. Let's type ".cpp" file.
94

95
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,620
OK, so now it is going to tell you, that we have multiple redefinitions of 'main'.
95

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,590
What does this mean?
96

97
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,170
It means that there are more than a ".cpp" file with the word 'main'. Multiple definitions of 'main'.
97

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,660
There should be only one file that has a 'main' function, only one that has this line,
98

99
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,650
OK. So we need to get rid of one of these two files.
99

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,860
There are two tricks.
100

101
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,600
The easiest and I like it more,
101

102
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,470
you right-click here,
102

103
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,380
and rename it to anything that isn't ".cpp". Let's say ".txt" here, for example, or
103

104
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,010
underscore.
104

105
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,550
Now, the program would be fine because now this file is just a text file, nothing else. The other way,
105

106
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,510
and I don't like it a lot.
106

107
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,130
Sometimes the Eclipse isn't consistent.
107

108
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,580
Right-click
108

109
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,890
here and tell it "Resource Configurations", "Exclude from Build" and select these two choices, then OK
109

110
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:09,620
this choice is telling the compiler to ignore this "cpp" file
110

111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,040
That is all for today.
111

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,630
I don't think you need to know more at the moment. Just start to create your own project. start to
112

113
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,480
explore as much as possible. The "Build" menu here is one of the most important menus.
113

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
In a next video,
114

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,560
I will show in a separate video that we go to the settings here and we go to the, you see here "GCC"
115

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,600
and "C++". This one here, the "C++" one in the "Miscellaneous",
116

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,130
you can add here, as we will do in a separate video "--std=14" or 17,
117

118
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,530
We will know in the next video about that.
118

119
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,840
There are slides also attached to the video.
119

120
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,970
Also, check it out.
120

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,570
That is it. :)
