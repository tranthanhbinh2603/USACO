Congratulations on running your first "Hello World" program!
1

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,990
The caveat here that I would like to share with you is something about configuring the compiler.
2

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:18,300
C++ has many recent standards, C++ 11 came with a very, very big jump in the C++ syntax,
3

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,680
14 did a good refining to 11, 17 has like another good jump and so on.
4

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,980
However, the first thing to keep in mind is that different "GCC" compilers support different 
5

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,760
versions of C++.
6

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,450
So, if you can stick to the latest "GCC" compiler, this is much better for you, but here is the trick, 
7

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,280
even having the latest C++ compiler doesn't mean by default 
8

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,080
it will compile your latest code.  and here is one thing that you might face a lot,
9

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,380
You might have a code from my code collection and it compiles on my side, 
10

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,250
but it doesn't compile on your side.
11

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,370
When this happens, 99% it doesn't mean something is wrong in the code, just probably something is
12

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,480
wrong in the compiler itself.
13

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:13,920
So let's go a little more. In C++, to support C++ 11, you need at least a GCC version of (4.8)
14

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,060
to support 14, you need (5.2) at least, 
15

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
to support 17, you need version (8.0).
16

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,550
Sometimes it isn't easy for everyone to have the latest version, Why? 
17

18
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,840
For example, some guys on some Linux based system might prefer to keep using (5.2) in his system, 
18

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,530
because it's very stable for example, 
19

20
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,860
or he's hesitant about moving further.
20

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,870
So, maybe at least something like (5.2) would be a good idea. In case you can not upgrade, 
21

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,370
or you're facing some difficulties with the compiler,
22

23
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,240
Here is some advice.
23

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,090
The website from "ideone.com" supports C++ 14, which should cover a lot of your code.
24

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,710
The C++ compiler in the "onlinegdb.com" website supports also online compilation for C++ 17.
25

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,870
So, if it happens that you suspect that, "Oh, This code might be C++ 17 and I don't have a support for that!",
26

27
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:14,120
you might try first these C++ online compilers. If your compiler supports C++ 11, 
27

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,790
this should be very good for a lot of examples in this course, because C++ 11 already is a very 
28

29
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,330
big jump in the modern C++ syntax. 
29

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,550
Here, there are few steps to follow to configure "Eclipse", you right-click on the project, select 'Properties',
30

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,190
'C++ Build', 'Settings' and go to this keyword “Miscellaneous”, and add one of these guys.
31

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,910
So, here's what you see when you right-click on the project, you go to 'C++ build', 'Settings'. Here in C++ Eclipse
32

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,000
there are always two sections, one of them is for C programming language, and the other one
33

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,170
is for C++ programming language.
34

35
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,960
Be careful, because in most of the cases guys get confused and configure the C not the C++.
35

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
You have to be here in the C++ section.
36

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,780
Here, you would find this keyword “Miscellaneous” .
37

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,440
Click it, now in this text area, you are going to add,
38

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,530
" --std=c++14" for example or (C++ 17) or (C++ 11). 
39

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,770
If you don't, you are using the default of your compiler.
40

41
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,040
For the "CodeBlocks" guys, you should select the project, then from the top menu find the 'Settings', 'Compiler', 
41

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,300
then select the  'Toolchain Executable'.
42

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,570
And again, add one of these three choices.
43

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,880
Here, when you click the compiler, you will find the global compiler setting, click it, go to this tab 
44

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,860
the 'Toolchain Executable' and here in the C++ compiler section add " --std=c++14"
45

46
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,910
or 17 or more.
46

47
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,830
This way you have already configured your compiler. In case you are using another IDE, 
47

48
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,400
just google how to add the C++ version to your code.
48

49
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:04,440
One concern here, some of the IDEs like "CodeLite" provide different checkboxes, 
49

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,410
like one checkbox for 11, another for 14, another for 17.
50

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,180
Please select only one of them.
51

52
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,800
For example, the latest. OK, here is an important verification step.
52

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,000
I would like you to run this code, this code will tell you what your current configured compiler is.
53

54
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,920
OK, so if you run,  it is going to print either "pre-standard C++",
54

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,730
98, 11, 14, 17. If your compiler is printing 11
55

56
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,770
It should be good for most of the cases.
56

57
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,990
If it can print 14, this is great!
57

58
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,490
If it can print 17, this is good!
58

59
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,970
If it is printing 98 or pre-standard, this is bad.
59

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,970
Try to figure out what's wrong about your compiler and change it.
60

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,980
The code is attached to the lecture content.
61

62
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,140
Please run it and double check it.
62

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,400
That's it! :)
