00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,920
In this session, we will highlight the tools we use in compiling.
1

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:15,420
There are mainly three ways to do compilation. The first way is you write some code in your notepad file, you
2

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,570
write the commands to compile the file and that's it.
3

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,420
This is not easy in the beginning,
4

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,060
so we will discuss it a bit later.
5

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,430
The second way is using an online site that compiles for you. This is the easiest way, but not so convenient.
6

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,000
So one site we are going to talk about is "ideone". You create an account for yourself.
7

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,390
It is going to save your codes.
8

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,840
You can compile and run, you can edit
9

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,190
and so on. The last way is using "IDEs". "IDEs" are tools
10

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,090
that makes your life much easier, much more professional, have a lot of shortcuts.
11

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,660
Sometimes it might be a bit problematic in the beginning to install it, but eventually, you can install it.
12

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,420
We are going to discuss two popular choices,
13

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,000
"CodeBlocks" and "Eclipse". "CodeBlocks" is much simpler and easier to set up.
14

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,560
"Eclipse" has a bit more support, more popular between people, but it might be a bit problematic to
15

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,010
install.
16

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,610
There are more other popular choices like "Visual Studio Code",
17

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,640
"CodeLite", "Sublime Text" and so on.
18

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,110
If you would like to try the "ideone.com" which I suggest for you to do at the beginning, go to "ideone"
19

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,320
which is just a website. Create your own account. Select the language like (C++ 14).
20

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,040
Write
21

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,130
and paste your code, just compile and run to get the results.
22

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,730
When you compile and run, you get a link to your code like this link.
23

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,930
This is how the website looks like. You would select from here C++ 14. You write here your own code.
24

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,930
If you have some input like we will see in next sessions, you click on "stdin" and just write your input.
25

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,140
After that,
26

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,110
you click this button like "Run" or so, then it is going to show you your code again and show you 
27

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,580
the output, like "My First Program. 
28

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,860
Helllllllo.".
29

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,960
You can edit the code again and you can just edit it, recompile it, you can download it
30

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,690
and so on. For the "IDEs", this is how an "Eclipse IDE" looks like.
31

32
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,630
if you notice, there are many menus here.
32

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,770
The code is here, projects are here, the console is here, it is a bit white one.
33

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,470
And this is the "CodeBlocks" one, look you can see 
34

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,110
it is also like it has a very similar structure,
35

36
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:34,040
but the console this time is black. Installing "IDEs", as I said, might be a bit problematic, but
36

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,750
is eventually doable. On online,
37

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,210
If you search the Internet, you will find typically a lot of materials like articles and videos about
38

39
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,810
how to install a specific "Codeblocks" or "Eclipse" or whatever.
39

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,930
Just Google your "IDE" and the operating system like, let's say, "fedora installing Codeblocks", "Eclipse on
40

41
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,040
Mac" and so on.
41

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,310
If you just google any of that and here are some links, you can just use them.
42

43
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,680
On Linux, I guess and Mac, typically installations are easy most of the time. In Windows, it might be a bit
43

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,860
problematic for some "IDEs" like "Eclipse". In the next videos, we will show some also of these installations
44

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,090
to make your life easier.
45

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,530
That is it for today. :)
