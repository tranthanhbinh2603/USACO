In this video, we will learn how to install Eclipse on Linux. Installing Eclipse sometimes isn't
1

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,830
an easy setup.
2

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,820
Meanwhile, it is a very nice IDE to use.
3

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,840
It is very impractical to support all the OS versions and their different setups.
4

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,700
Check out the approach here, first.
5

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,590
If it isn't your version or doesn't work with you, just google your version. Sadly, from OS to
6

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,040
another,
7

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,280
and even within the same OS setup, you may face different errors.
8

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,560
The good news, typically googling for the problem will end up with a solution, especially on 
9

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,750
a "StackOverFlow" website.
10

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,750
Here are some versions that you might like
11

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,670
try if the one here didn't work well.
12

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,390
The first step is just to go to google and just write "Download Eclipse" like this way, you should
13

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,390
find a page in google like this one typically.
14

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,140
Notice the whole name "C++ CDT". On the right side of the page here,
15

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,090
you should find a "Download" button, typically adjusted to your operating system.
16

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,610
Once you did that, you should find something called Eclipse Installer in the file.
17

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,330
Just double click on this file.
18

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,180
Some of the older versions have the installer directly to run.
19

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,160
So, there are two cases.
20

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,950
Either you have to install it or it is the executable, ready to run.
21

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,070
If you click, they just start to follow the normal path. It should find some internal files.
22

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,400
Click install and select here C++.
23

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,980
And if it asks for certificate, just mark all and just accept. Otherwise,
24

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,840
that is it. It should open for you. For Fedora,
25

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,730
also, I would like you first to try the installer in the previous system if it worked for you, great!
26

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,300
If it didn't, then you might try the "sudo dnf install -y eclipse-cdt" command, then reboot and probably
27

28
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,270
it is going to work. Again, for other operating systems,
28

29
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,430
start with the installer.
29

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,660
Otherwise, just try to google if there is someone who posted the command for that.
30

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,160
If you would like to run, just write in the terminal "eclipse" or in your search box.
31

32
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,290
It should look like this box. That is it. :)
