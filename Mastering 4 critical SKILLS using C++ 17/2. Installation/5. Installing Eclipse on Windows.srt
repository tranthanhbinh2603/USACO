In this video, we will learn how to install Eclipse on Windows. Installing Eclipse on Windows is
1

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,020
a bit problematic because it involves three steps.
2

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,100
This video is about Windows 10.
3

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,330
It is very impractical to support all "OSs" and their different versions.
4

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,860
Check out the approach here.
5

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,710
If it isn't your version or doesn't work, just google your version.
6

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,760
Sadly, from OS to another,
7

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,270
and even within the same OS setup, you may face different errors.
8

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,430
The good news, typically googling for the problem will end up with a solution, especially on 
9

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,590
a "StackOverFlow" website.
10

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,000
The first step is to install the "Java JDK", just google it.
11

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,470
It should be something like that,
12

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,550
but Oracle guys change things from time to time, so it should be something like that.
13

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:57,040
You go to their website. You will find that at the bottom you have (X86 for a 32bit) and (X64 for a 64bit).
14

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,270
It should be something like that.
15

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,630
Be careful, select the one that has ".exe" in its end.
16

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,600
Okay, then download and install
17

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,700
normally, nothing fancy.
18

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,730
The second step and very critical is installing the "MinGW".
19

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,990
The "MinGW" exists in two places on the web.
20

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,990
Just google "mingw". And one of the best ways is just to go to the "sourceforge" website and just click it,
21

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,700
download, and install normally.
22

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,810
If it asks you to the path, please provide this path.This one, OK.
23

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,500
The
24

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,880
third
25

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,260
critical step is adding the Windows to , the same path to the "System environment".
26

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,390
We mainly need to add 2 paths the "MinGw" path and the "JDK" path.  The "MinGw" path will be like (MinGW\bin).
27

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,720
This is a standard step. For the "JDK" it should be something like that.
28

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,850
There should be some post-fix here based on your version.
29

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,970
This is a standard step to add the System Environment,
30

31
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,760
so check out here your operating system version 
31

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,040
if you are in Windows 10. For Windows 10 you write here "env" in the search box,
32

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
it gives you here, "Edit the system environment variables".
33

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,330
You click on the "System Properties", and on "Advanced" then on "Environment Variables",
34

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,360
then you see some variables.
35

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,230
Click with the one that is "Path". Here in the path,
36

37
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,710
add "New" and write 2 paths, where the "MinGW\bin" path and the "JDK" path.
37

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,660
Click OK and save. If you face problems, please
38

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,150
double check first that you really added the path here,
39

40
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,610
second, restart your whole machine.
40

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,900
The last step is installing the "Eclipse" itself.
41

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Just google the "download eclipse IDE".
42

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,710
Notice here (C++ CDT) and download
43

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,350
the OS version, download the version that is good with your setup.
44

45
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,940
Typically, there is auto-generating one that is nice for you.
45

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,830
The second step, just launch the installer and start to follow the steps.
46

47
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,180
Select C++ here.
47

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,310
If it asks for certificates, mark all and keep going, then just run the Eclipse.
48

49
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,190
It is going to show you a welcome page like that.
49

50
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,690
Click the 'X', and that is it.
50

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,750
Thank you. :)
