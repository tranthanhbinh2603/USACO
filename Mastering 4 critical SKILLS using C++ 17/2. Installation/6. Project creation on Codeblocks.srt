00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,180
In this video, we will discuss how to create a project using CodeBlocks. When you open
1

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,410
the IDE, you will notice there are many menus here.
2

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,360
You are encouraged in the future, one by one to explore.
3

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,500
There are two important things here.
4

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,610
You can create a new project or open an existing project.
5

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,720
So let's go with creating a new project.
6

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,180
You select here a console application, and then go, then C++,
7

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,770
then you start to give a title and there is here a path to a workspace.
8

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,260
Workspace is something that has a lot of projects and every project has something like that, as
9

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,860
one unit.
10

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,190
The very critical advice here, make sure the path of your workspace and the path of your project and
11

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,220
the path of any file name doesn't include any space.
12

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,500
So let's make a name here like this "test111". We just write a name here and give a path here.
13

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,910
Don't play with these two things.
14

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,960
Notice here the "cbp" extension.
15

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,510
This is the project title name.
16

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,440
When you would like to open an existing project, you go and browse this 'cbp' file.
17

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,140
Let's go with next. Some default option.
18

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,450
Make sure that this is "GCC Compiler" and then finish.
19

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,630
When you open the project, you will have some initial code here in the "main.cpp" file.
20

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,720
And then let's build and run the code. It's very important to keep in mind the following, to get
21

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,360
results of executing a code,
22

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,960
you have to always do two things.
23

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,920
You have to Compile it (to build it), and you have to run it. From this menu here
24

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,220
you see, there is a build option here.
25

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,430
So you build the first.
26

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,740
After that, you start to run from here.
27

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,550
Then it gives you this black screen with the "Hello world!".
28

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,540
If you entered "Enter", this screen will get closed.
29

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,180
Now, there is a nice choice here to build and run at the same time.
30

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,400
And this is what I actually usually do, like let's say "111" here and then click on it,
31

32
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,740
then it is updated with "111".
32

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Now let's make another update here and just try to run.
33

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,770
You would notice that the "Hello world!" didn't update with this new one.
34

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,270
Why?
35

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,920
Because you forgot to build and run,
36

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,980
Ok. So you always need to build and run, or easily, try to run this one.
37

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,670
So let's try to build and run again.
38

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,680
Oh! they are disabled.
39

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,180
Why?
40

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Because you forgot to close this window.
41

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,860
You have to close it first, then come and build and run.
42

43
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,410
You can also come to this menu here "Build" and click build and run.
43

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
You will notice 'F9' allows you to build & run.
44

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,060
This is actually what you can do usually. Like, 'F9' is going to build and run. this is how
45

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,320
you can write your own code.
46

47
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,410
Let's try to make an error.
47

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,760
Let's remove this semicolon ';',
48

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,660
and then build and run. You will notice here it says "error: expected ';' before 'return' ".
49

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,180
There is a missing semicolon here.
50

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,720
So now, let's return it and click on build and run.
51

52
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,640
Perfect! Notice here it says "0 error(s)".
52

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,660
It is important to always verify that this is a zero-errors-program.
53

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,450
What if I wanted to rename this file to something else?
54

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,190
Let's right-click and search for "rename".
55

56
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,150
You don't find it.
56

57
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,440
You have, sadly, to close the window first, then come here and say "rename".
57

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,650
Let's make it "main111.cpp" 
58

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,930
Now, you can double click and get it again.
59

60
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,620
Let's get here something new, and then build and run.
60

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,930
So far so good.
61

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,950
What else?
62

63
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,300
Let's say you would like to create another "CPP" file, maybe here.
63

64
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:31,310
Let's right-click on the project here. Sorry, on the sources or the project from the menu "file". "new", "file" and
64

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,750
select "source file".
65

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,660
Go and let's give it here
66

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,530
C++ also. And it asks you about which directory and file name. Browse from here.
67

68
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,470
Probably, it would be the same project as yours,
68

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,300
and let's say "hello.cpp", enter, now it is updated here.
69

70
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,030
Click "All" and "Finish".
70

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,330
Now you get this new file which is empty.
71

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,170
Let's 
72

73
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,210
copy & paste this code here, and let's run it.
73

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,420
If you try to run it, it gives an error 
74

75
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,520
"multiple definition of 'main' ".
75

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,310
It means the 'main' is duplicated.
76

77
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,050
There are two things with this line here,
77

78
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,850
'main' and 'main'. C++ doesn't accept that in a project. There should be only one 'main'.
78

79
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,970
Later we will know that the compiler is searching for this one.
79

80
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,890
If it sees it in two files, it gets confused.
80

81
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,200
There are two ways to handle this problem.
81

82
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,680
An easier one; that I do not encourage you to use it.
82

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,220
Change this one from 'main' to 'main(something)'.
83

84
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,100
It should be also unique, like 'main1' or 'main2' and so on.
84

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:37,700
Now try to run, It is going to run. But this isn't the standard way to do it.
85

86
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,960
Let's return this one here.
86

87
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,820
The way that you should do it, you go to the compiler here.
87

88
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,550
Let's say you want to cancel this 'main' file, you want only this one that has the 'cpp' file.
88

89
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,510
come on
89

90
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,220
the one that you want to discard for now,
90

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,700
right-click,
91

92
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,230
go to "Options",
92

93
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,610
remove the "compile file",
93

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,600
right-click,
94

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,470
go to options,
95

96
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,740
remove the link file.
96

97
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,070
Now, this guy is now with a 'main' but you can now run
97

98
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,070
This "hello.cpp" in a normal way.
98

99
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,060
So here it is just giving you "111". This way during the project, you can create a lot of files. Every
99

100
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,900
time you are adding a new file, just cancel the old one or return it from here, if you would like,
100

101
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,270
by marking these two choices.
101

102
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,140
So far, we learned how to rename, we learned how to review.
102

103
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,630
If it happens at any moment of time that you corrupted this view, let's say you close this 'X' in a
103

104
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,140
wrong way,
104

105
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,890
come here
105

106
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,390
in the 'View", tell him the "Perspectives", get me for the default one. It is going to return everything as it is,
106

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,410
because this is a bit a common error for the guys.
107

108
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,050
You can come here on this project and,
108

109
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,260
right-click
109

110
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,130
and say...
110

111
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,150
I guess in this one here, you can tell it to...
111

112
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,380
"Open Project Folder in File Browser", is going to show you the project here, you can see that this is the
112

113
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,100
actual project path.
113

114
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,990
So you can take it and maybe you can go and maybe visualize it here.
114

115
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,130
Let's go here.
115

116
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,630
You find some "bin", inside it you find...
116

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
This is an executable. For Windows guys
117

118
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,070
It will have ".exe". Every time you compile your code,
118

119
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,960
this file is going to be removed and another file would be created.
119

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,230
Here in the "obj" you find something that ending with ".o".
120

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:26,490
The ".o" file is an intermediate step, that we will know more about it later. If it happens that 
121

122
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,460
anything that is weird in your project, maybe you come back to the project here and
122

123
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,730
right-click
123

124
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,030
and tell it to clean or to rebuild, then tell it
124

125
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,560
"Yes", this is going to clean
125

126
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,090
if there is something wrong in the project that happened in a way or another. I would like also
126

127
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,030
to show you some about the settings of this project.
127

128
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,030
You can right-click
128

129
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,620
on this project here and tell it "Build Options...". It is going to show you here options to enable warnings.
129

130
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,010
This is something very useful.
130

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,720
So tell him I like this one
131

132
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,350
and this guy,
132

133
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:07,520
and this guy and also this guy. This one enables warnings that you might create in your
133

134
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,420
own projects.
134

135
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:17,420
In the next video, you will also find that I am talking about enabling the compiler like C++ or like
135

136
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,800
C++ 14.
136

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
You mainly come from the menu here.
137

138
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,400
You will see this in another video.
138

139
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm just showing you the 'Menu', 'Compiler'
139

140
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,990
and then you go to the "Toolchain executable"' here, from the compiler.
140

141
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,600
And then you add here "--std=c++14", you will see this in another video,
141

142
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,140
but I'm just showing you how to reach it from the menu from here.
142

143
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:53,490
What else to consider here? The shortcuts, if you went to the settings here and say,... "Editor"
143

144
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,140
and then you could find here, there are in the menu here, there is something we call "Shortcuts".
144

145
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
Where is it?
145

146
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,220
keyboard shortcut.
146

147
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,870
There are a lot of shortcuts here that you can use in your system.
147

148
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,790
For example, remember the build and run.
148

149
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,340
You will notice the 'F9'. You are encouraged to explore all of these guys.
149

150
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,470
One of the interesting features, but in code is what we call a "Code Formatter". "Code Formatter",
150

151
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,230
when you write a code but it isn't organized, then using some shortcut, you can reorganize the
151

152
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,760
code for that if you would like to.
152

153
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,570
The editor in CodeBlocks doesn't have a formatter by default, so you have to provide it by yourself.
153

154
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:49,800
So you mainly go to the "shortcuts" and then you have to go to the "plugins" here, and then
154

155
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,400
you go to the "Source code formatter" here, and then you start to provide it here.
155

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,680
I wrote here [control-shift-f], so you provide it, give it [control-shift-f] and make sure you add it here.
156

157
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,270
This way, the code can be reformatted.
157

158
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,030
Let's see
158

159
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,870
what does this mean here?
159

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,500
Let's see.
160

161
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,670
The code is like not organized and this happens a lot from beginners. If you press the [control-
161

162
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,640
shift-f] is going to be a bit, a bit handled.
162

163
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:27,870
The one in CodeBlocks isn't as good as the one in Eclipse. But anyway, it should still be a help. That is All. :)
