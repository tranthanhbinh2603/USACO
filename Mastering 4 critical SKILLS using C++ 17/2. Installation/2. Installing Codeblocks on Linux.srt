In this video, we will learn how to install "CodeBlocks" on Linux. Installing "CodeBlocks" is an easy experience

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,680
most of the time, however, it might not be the same for everyone.

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,570
Sadly, it is very impractical to support all OS versions and they are different like setups.

Check out the approach here.

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,240
If it isn't your version or doesn't work,  just google
5

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,450
your version. Sadly from OS to another, and even within the same OS setup, you may face

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,230
different errors.

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,480
The good news, typically googling for the problem will end up with a solution, especially on "stackoverflow"

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,870
website. The way to install on Ubuntu is as simple as you just follow with the following Ubuntu

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,510
commands.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,220
I think I tried them on my (Ubuntu 16) and also they should be working on (Ubuntu 18).

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,640
And the installation in Fedora is much easier if you are using another version like "CentOS" or whatever, just
12

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,660
try to google for whatever commands to install the "CodeBlocks".
13

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
If you are done with the installation, hopefully, no problems,
14

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,870
you just run it from the terminal, write "codeblocks" or in the search box,
15

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,600
you write "codeblocks".

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,210
That is it. :)
