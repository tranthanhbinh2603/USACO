To convert a string to a number, we will just go in a very, very, very simple way and we will just
1

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,190
iterate on the string and convert it to integer.
2

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,760
To do that, let's refresh something.
3

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,970
If you have five digits, like one, two, three, four, five. I would like to convert 12345
4

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,730
12345
5

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,200
The way to do that in math is to keep multiplying with 10 and adding a digit, for example, starting with
6

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,120
one. One times 10 is 20, add the next digit 2.
7

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,560
Now we have 12, 12 times 10 is one hundred and twenty adds the plus.
8

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,190
It is what now?
9

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,780
123 multiplied by ten and add four. it's now
10

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,280
1234 multiplied by ten, add five.
11

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,490
It's 12345. 
12

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,830
So we actually all what we need is to keep iterating five steps. In every step,
13

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,840
we take the current number, multiply it by ten and add the current digit.
14

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,510
The digit is in a string format.
15

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,690
If you would like to extract the corresponding integer of it, we can just subtract a zero digit from
16

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,290
it because the digits...,  the characters are from zero to nine matches the character from zero to 90 integers.
17

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,880
Just we need to remove this zero because it will have some value let's say maybe 50.
18

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,910
I forget the actual number.
19

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,910
So this is how we convert a character digit to an integer digit and then we keep adding it.
20

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,560
Once we are done with that.
21

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,050
Once we are done with that, then the one number would be converted.
22

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,130
And the second problem would like to do the grouping
23

24
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:46,200
of the numbers here. To do that, we will simply iterate on the string, and whenever the current letter
24

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,490
doesn't match the previous letter, we know we have a new group.
25

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,010
But be careful if you are at "i" equal to zero, then there are no groups at the moment.
26

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,760
So if this is the case, we separate them by spaces, otherwise we just print the current letter.
27

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,190
So this how we can split the groups with the spaces in an easy way.
