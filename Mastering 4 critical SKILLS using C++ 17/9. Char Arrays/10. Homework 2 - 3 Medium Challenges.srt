Homework set number two, in the first one very relevant to the previous problem, you will read a string
1

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,220
and compress it as following, you will compress each group to something like, let's say you have four "C"s,
2

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,750
then you compress to "c4".
3

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,830
And between different groups use underscore, for example, here we have four "C"s so write C4, three "D"s,
4

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,490
so write D3.
5

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,690
a lot of "X"s, X8, and one E, e1.
6

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,620
And we put exit,
7

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,700
we would underscore in the middle, here we have a lot of "X"s, so it's x8. In the second problem you
8

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,670
would like to read and compare two strings and you should develop that by yourself.
9

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,820
you will not use a < operator between two strings,
10

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,240
so you will read two strings, but you will do the comparison by yourself and follow
11

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,460
follow the way that we learned about how to compare two strings.
12

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,340
In this problem, you will read a very long string, but it would be at least of six digits and you would
13

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,410
like to add the number five five five to it.
14

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,170
You shouldn't try to convert it,
15

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,580
it is very, very, very long string to integer because it will exceed the maximum limit.
16

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,780
For example, if the input is like this number and you added the four fives, it should be like that
17

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,040
one.
18

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,850
So try to develop an algorithm that correctly handled this problem.
19

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,250
That's all.
