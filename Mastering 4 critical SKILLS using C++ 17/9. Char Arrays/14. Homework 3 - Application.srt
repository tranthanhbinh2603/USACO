00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,670
In this homework, we will develop an application for an employee system,
1

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,060
we have a factory of several employees that we would like to manage and we would like to have the following
2

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,180
ability: to add a new employee, print all of them,
3

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:22,190
delete someone by the age range, or update salary by given name, this program will keep running forever
4

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,700
and then the user take a choice from one to four to do these choices.
5

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,630
So let's let's get in more details for choice
6

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,220
number one, we would like to allow the manager to enter information of an employee.
7

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,150
The information is name, age, salary and gender letter, add the information to your
8

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,550
database, which is your internal memory for now.
9

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,200
printing all of them or, in the choice number three, you will take a start range and end range and remove
10

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,580
all of the employees that has this, that the age is within the start and the end.
11

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,150
in the fourth choice, the user enters a name, then salary, and then you update the salary of a person
12

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,040
of his name.
13

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,170
We are assuming here that names are symbols.
14

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,870
Let's see some screenshots, here
15

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,520
we have the menu of four choices.
16

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,110
The user entered one that I enter the name Mustafa age 3 blah blah blah and gender M, for 
17

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,960
simplicity I use the names without spaces.
18

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,540
And then I added another name and then I asked for two, which is printing all of them please.
19

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,490
So two employees would be printed.
20

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,200
After that, we asked for four, which is updating salary by name.
21

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,370
You would enter a name which again doesn't have spaces and a salary.
22

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,090
If after that you try to print them, you will notice that the salary of Mustafa here changed 
23

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,490
from thirty-three... from one, two, three, four, five to five hundred and five.
24

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,960
Finally, we would like to do a deletion by age so we enter a start and end the age
25

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,930
Then all of the employees in this range would be removed.
26

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,320
Observe here, Mona here within the range so it would be deleted, but Mustafa will remain for
27

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,590
us.
28

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,840
That's all the program is.
29

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,660
simple requirements do not complicate things for yourself and try to make it just that simple.
