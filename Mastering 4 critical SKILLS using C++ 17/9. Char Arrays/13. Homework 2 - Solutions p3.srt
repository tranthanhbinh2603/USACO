00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,810
This problem is just the stress on the addition of two numbers, having a carry, moving it from a number
1

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,920
to another and so on.
2

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,330
This is mainly the purpose of it.
3

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,530
To solve the problem, I started by reading the string, and to add the number to a second number, you
4

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,530
have to add from the right side of it.
5

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,930
That's why we will start to iterate.
6

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,910
But every time we get the digit from the end of it, "sz-1-i" is mainly the digit.
7

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,010
Removing minus zero is getting the actual data.
8

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,220
In the first of four iterations we can add the five because we have number that's five five five five.
9

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,180
So in the first four times we add the five.
10

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,260
So we think the digit let's say it is two and then we have the digit.
11

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,550
We add five to the digit.
12

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,500
Now it's seven.
13

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,560
But what if it was, for example, nine and you have a digit, for example, that's another eight?
14

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,520
For example, this is now 17.
15

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,660
So in math, we have to write seven and have a carry of one.
16

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,510
That's why we have here the carry initially zero.
17

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,120
But if the digit is greater than or equal 10 in math, we remove a ten and make it like a one carry.
18

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,810
To be added with us, otherwise, the carry is zero. At this moment, the is again, value from zero to nine.
19

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,630
So we get it back here to the array again and we keep going.
20

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,840
So the idea is get the next digit, add for over it five.
21

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,930
If there is a carry from the previous time, just add it and then we have here handling for the
22

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,000
new carry for us. The carry after every time we either would be one or would be just zero.
23

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,870
That's all mainly implementation and some math from the elementary school.
24

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,830
This code isn't very efficient
25

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:47,330
if the string is very huge like you can expect, for example, that you don't need to go maybe 
26

27
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,150
more than maybe five or six iterations because at some point of time there are no more carry any more
27

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,930
and there is no more iterations anymore.
28

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,130
But I like to keep it simple to this point.
