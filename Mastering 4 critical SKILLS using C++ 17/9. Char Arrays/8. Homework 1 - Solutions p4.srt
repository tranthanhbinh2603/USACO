For the Is Subsequence problem, it can be solved in a nice way.
1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,480
I hope it wasn't so hard for you.
2

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,780
The idea is based on matching.
3

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,380
Let's say let's say we have here a string like aaabcd
4

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,310
Let's say the target string is, for example, it is only b, and d. it seems we would like this b to be
5

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,550
matched with this b and this d needs to be matched with this d so the idea you start from the a and
6

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,350
check if it matched with b or not, if it matches, you mark that you match at the first letter, second
7

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,620
letter and so on.
8

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,140
So here does a match the first? No.  Does a match? No. does a match? No.  Does B match?
9

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,550
Yes.
10

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,260
Then now we are here would like to match with the d. Does c match? No. Does d match?
11

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,440
Yes we are here so we are done with the string.
12

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,630
So the idea is to iterate on the big string and try to keep matching with the small one.
13

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,280
So here is the next to_match here.
14

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
The next match position in the small_str 
15

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,040
is zero. I am iterating on the big one and then I'm comparing if the current big match the current 
16

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,620
small if it matched a current letter, we increase the match.
17

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,710
If it happens that we are done with the whole small string, then we will have completely found a subsequent
18

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,870
otherwise, 
19

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,210
the case is no, there are different cases here.
20

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,490
You might, for example, match all of these small substring, but still more letters to match.
21

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,060
So it will end up here and so on.
22

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,860
So, yeah, I hope you understood this.
23

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,580
Nice idea.
