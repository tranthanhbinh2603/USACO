00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,530
Using lambda expression with their food is very straightforward, but I thought it's good also to see

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,580
some good snap, it's free.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,640
So remember, if we would like to use the full expression, we really have to use the ads and we need

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,960
to use the three dots.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,250
And practically speaking, the generation time would be the first element.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,290
And this guy is going to be expanded over time.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,100
So I would like to print a bunch of numbers sent to a print function.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,410
We can use here an expression to print and then comma the three dots.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,260
So the expression we are doing here, we are putting here at around Brahms's, OK, or even in this

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,380
like a function that we have now, the function, the expression here is just the printing, the Addicks

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:50,010
first column and then some space that's very close to the Bush example that we used before and before

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,580
the expression we would like now to use the lambda function.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,320
So let's say I would like to make a decorator function here some function print element.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,780
This is a very straightforward lambda function that is taking some output and putting something before

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,460
an object in some ways.

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,490
And just you put it here and it always says that's some logic to decorate something maybe similar as

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:11,850
you like.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,750
Now in a very similar way to the applying function, we can call now the print element ARGs and the

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,540
three daughters.

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,890
So now the whole expression is going to use this function.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,160
That is an advantage here compared to using a normal function like by parameter to the print.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,700
One might say, OK, let's let's send the function to print the element and use it here.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,980
You're going to face difficulties and the easiest way is to make it all of them of the same parameter,

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,800
like your printing bunch of integers, bunch of doubles and so on.

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,720
But if you'd like to print a bunch of different things are going to give you a hard time with no expression.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,250
It's very easy because you can internally define it so you don't care about the type and just using

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,390
it.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,650
So actually the expression make your life easier if you would like to print a bunch of numbers, a bunch

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,520
of different data types using for the expression, let's see another example.

30
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:12,840
What if I would like to have a function lambda that kibitzer and it allows the arguments as simple as

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,840
you come here in the clouds and just say ARC's the notice, the three dots are after the arcs, not

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,320
before it.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,290
So this is how you can use it and you can now have like maybe the size of as you like, maybe another

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,030
scenario if you have in the main, I would like to just develop your own two fold expression directly

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,790
as a as a lambda function.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,220
So you define Lunga and you just give it the normal parameter back and then you start use it.

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,580
Normally, as you see, using the expression with fold is very straightforward, but sometimes the guy

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,600
is like, good, confused.

39
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh, is it possible how to use it and so on it.
