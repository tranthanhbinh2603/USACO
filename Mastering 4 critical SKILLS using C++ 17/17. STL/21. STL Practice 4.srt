0
1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,620
Let's continue our practice. In this one, you would be first given N full names, what is a full name?
1

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,110
It is like  â€” your name more than a K words.
2

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,120
So it starts with K for the number of words in your name, then the list of keywords.
3

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,880
For example, as an input, you take first, 5, five her is for 5 full names, then every full name
4

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,570
starts with a number. let's say 3, then Mustafa Saad Ibrahim.
5

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,790
These are 3 words for my full name.
6

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,790
3 Mustafa Saad Ali, 3 Asmaa Talaat Morsi, and so on.
7

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:39,360
So as you see, you have here like â€” a number of full names, then the number of words per
8

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,350
a name then the three words here.
9

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,120
Now for queries, you are also reading queue for Q queries.
10

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,100
each query is a sub full name. It again starts with K then K words.
11

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,950
For example, one query will be here,
12

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,580
3 queries.
13

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,020
One query is 2 words,
14

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,560
Mustafa Saad. You are to find all full names that start with Mustafa Saad, which are
15

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,480
if you go here one step back.
16

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,190
This is start with Mustafa Saad,
17

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,910
this is start with Mustafa Saad, and this is start with Mustafa Saad.
18

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,220
So we have 3 names starting with that.
19

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,170
So you are given full names as an input and the sub full name as a query and you are to find the sub name.
20

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,830
If we give one Asmaa, it's going to give you Asmaa here and Asmaa here, 2 entries.
21

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:32,100
So you print this vector of all of the items that are starting with this sub full names. Give yourself a couple
22

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,140
of minutes to think about it and maybe put it.
23

24
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:44,650
Here is one nice way using the map, we're going to build a map of string and vector of a string, and here is
24

25
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,200
the idea, here is how we will build this map: For every input full name, we are going to generate all possible
25

26
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,570
sub full names from it,
26

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,190
then we are going to map them to the full name.
27

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,450
For example, if you have the full name of Mostafa Saad Ibrahim, which consist of three words, we will
28

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,420
add 3 entries in the map from it.
29

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,260
You notice here, the two is the full name, Mustafa Saad Ibrahim, Mustafa Saad Ibrahim,
30

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
and so on. This is the full way.
31

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,780
Here are the three possible generation,
32

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,400
It could be the first word only Mostafa, the first and second Mostafa Saad, the first and second and third
33

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,050
Mostafa Saad Ibrahim.
34

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,770
So if I give you a name of 5 entries, 5 words, you are going to generate five
35

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,670
entries for me.
36

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,240
Once you generated all of that for every map you can, simply for a query, build its sub full name
37

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,940
and just go and check in the map 
38

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
its list.
39

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,990
So here is how to code it.
40

41
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,160
We first defined the map, and we read number of inputs.
41

42
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,890
We read here the number of K words and then we iterate. We have two things here,
42

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,570
I have a current full name,
43

44
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,620
this will be the concatenation of the whole names.
44

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,730
So if I give it Mustafa Saad Ibrahim, it will be a concatenation of  Mustafa Saad
45

46
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,530
Ibrahim with a space-separated. The vector of string names here is the list of all the sub full names.
46

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,440
So I go on the input, one by one, take the word, let's say first I take the word Mustafa, then I
47

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,320
am concatenating it to the string and pushing it in the string, then I took the word saad then
48

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm concatenating it here and now pushing back here the word saad. Now I'm taking
49

50
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,650
here the word Ibrahim, concatenating it here and then I am adding here also Mustafa Saad Ibrahim.
50

51
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:39,430
So notice here, this current full name, we are building it step by step and we are adding it here.
51

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,920
So now we are added so far 3 things.
52

53
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,110
... OK. We have now here in the names 3 things, Mostafa 
53

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,790
as a string,
54

55
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,390
Mostafa Saad Ibrahim as a string, Mostafa Saad as a string.
55

56
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,450
We iterate in all of the strings and we start to push back
56

57
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,540
the str that we have, Mustafa, then Mostafa Saad, then Mustafa Saad Ibrahim to that full
57

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,240
name, which is just Mustafa Saad Ibrahim.
58

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,290
By the way, this is inefficient iterating,
59

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,700
you better use the reference here.
60

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,890
Let's go more. Now for the querying, we are reading a query here, we are again going back to the current full name
61

62
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,110
in the same exact way.
62

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,030
So if I give a query, like Mostafa saad, two items, It is going to be one string Mustafa, space, Saad then I'm
63

64
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,030
double checking the map,
64

65
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,950
does it exist?
65

66
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,530
If it exists, we retrieve it and we just print it, that simple.
66

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,900
So I hope you see how the map here can make our life much much easier than probably the iterative way
67

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,660
that you were thinking about it.
68

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:38,850
That's it.
