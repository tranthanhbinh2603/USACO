Another interesting data structure is named stack, stack is completely the reverse of a queue, you can
1

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,830
think of a stack like a box of that have some books,
2

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,000
you put book number one, book number two, book number three, till book number 10.
3

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,520
If you would like to get a book now from the stack, you have to get from the top of the box.
4

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,350
So this means that the last one is the first one to get out, on the other side,
5

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,600
the queue was the first one is the first one to get out,
6

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,130
so queue here was first in, first out,
7

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,980
but here in the stack, it is last in, first out.
8

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,550
So when you enter a stack, it is more like a box,
9

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,910
The one get first just got trapped down there,
10

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,170
but in 
11

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,460
in a queue, the one who gets first just get outside of the queue,
12

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500
so looking to this stack, we enter the number one, two, three, four, five, if you would like to
13

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,830
pop
14

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,010
the five is the one to get outside,
15

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,230
think of it always like a stack of books. In terms of code and a very similar way,
16

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,950
let's define a stack of string,
17

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,900
you start to push Ibrahim, Saad, Mostafa, and then you print in a very similar way.
18

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,060
But what is the output here?
19

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,750
Would it be Ibrahim Saad Mostafa?
20

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,160
No, it would be the reverse would be Mostafa Saad Ibrahim.
21

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,970
OK, so the queue would print them Ibrahim Saad Mostafa, but stack would print them Mostafa Saad Ibrahim.
22

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,220
That's it.
