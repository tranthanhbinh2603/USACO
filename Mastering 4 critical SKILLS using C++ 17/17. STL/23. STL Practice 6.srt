00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,080
In this practice, we just would like to show how our library system can be rewritten in an easier
1

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,940
way when it comes to the STL.
2

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,030
So remember, the user class has previously an array of books,
3

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,880
when we would like to return to the book ID, we need to verify where is the book ID and then we need
4

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,340
to make a shifting in the array to remove something.
5

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,280
If you would like to borrow, you have to iterate over all the array to make sure that it exists
6

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,700
or not.
7

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,040
Now, if you'd like to move using the set using the STL, you can use the set with the user.
8

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,280
It would easily allow you to remove and sort the books.
9

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,900
So that's it.
10

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,610
If you would like to borrow a book you just inserted in the array and if you would like to return a
11

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,090
copy, you find where is it in the array and then if it exists, you just remove it,
12

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,430
you don't care now about shifting,
13

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,390
It will be done for you.
14

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,940
If you would like to know if the book is borrowed, you find it and double-check if the Iterator isn't
15

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,670
null. If you'd like to print, you just iterate directly and print it. From the library system perspective,
16

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,390
you can switch the books and users to be a couple of vectors, you can sort now using the beginning
17

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,170
and dot end, and you can use the range-based for loops to iterate and print the users.
18

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,430
That's it.
19

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,310
As you see, there is some code reduction that happened, and the less code you do the fewer bugs
20

21
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,330
you would introduce to your code. That's it.
