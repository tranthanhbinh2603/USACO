00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,950
The third homework set, the first problem is a bit an easy one, you would like to read an integer
1

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,270
N followed by reading N strings, and you have to print only the strings that consist of the
2

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,270
following conditions.
3

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,510
First, they have to be only two letters.
4

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,850
Second, this letter can be either N  or O, but you should ignore the lower case and upper
5

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,730
case of numbers.
6

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,040
You don't care about that.
7

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,110
So it could be n small, N the capital, o small, O capital and you don't care about the order it could
8

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,040
be N and O, O and N
9

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,720
and so on, it is eventually have to be the word N O.
10

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,940
And according to that, something like N O
11

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,700
Is rejected ON is rejected.
12

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,070
no
13

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,790
Is rejected.
14

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,140
Oh sorry.
15

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,170
I reverse it, no on no are the right ones.
16

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,000
Something like YEs is incorrect.
17

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,410
Something like Nooo is incorrect because it consists of many, many letters.
18

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,980
So overall just a word of N and O and both of them have to be there, for example, something like
19

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,950
NN is invalid, OO is invalid and so on.
20

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,370
Yeah, so this is a list here of things you OO is ignored, we don't print it.
21

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,340
In the second problem, you are to reverse an integers N, read that integer n and reverse it, print it
22

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,700
the reversed one, and the reversed one multiply by times three, for example, for input, one, two,
23

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,550
three, the output is reverse,  three, two, one.
24

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,400
And if you multiply this number by three, it will be this number.
25

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,320
Here you will print the multiplication table read N and M for the multiplication table and then print it
26

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,970
as following, for example, three and four, then we would like to try every number from one to three
27

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,930
was every number from one to four and print it as I am printing it here.
28

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,000
in special sum one, which might be a little harder than previous ones, you will read an integer T
29

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,690
for the number of test cases for each test case, you will read N then N integers, ABC and you have
30

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,120
to print the following summation for every test case.
31

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,710
it's as follows,  let's say the numbers are ABCDE and so on.
32

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:18,810
A, then B*B the submission of A plus B plus BB plus CCC plus DDDD plus EEEEE and so on.
33

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,040
Observe in every step we are duplicating or repeating the number for K times here K is one,
34

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,520
so we used A for once, B at the K for two.
35

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,780
We repeating B twice.
36

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,510
This is the third term we repeated C three times.
37

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,290
This is a fourth term we repeated D four times.
38

39
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,540
This is the fifth term, we repeated E five times and so on.
39

40
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,420
As an example, here is the input, two testcases
40

41
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,490
The first testcase is five seven two.
41

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,940
So we will print  as follow.
42

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,920
We need five and the seven twice and two three times.
43

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,330
In this testcase,
44

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,650
we need one, two, twice, three, three times, four, four times.
45

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,740
And so and you need to develop this summation, that's all.
