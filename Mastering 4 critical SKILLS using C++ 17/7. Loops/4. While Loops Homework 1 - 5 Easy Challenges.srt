00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,710
Homework set number one for while loops, the first problem is a very direct one, you are to print
1

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:13,920
a range you will read two numbers X and Y, two integers, and then you are just to print to all of the integers,
2

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,120
four, five, six, seven between these two numbers, every one of them on a separate line.
3

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,930
That's simple.
4

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:27,770
In the second problem, you will read an integer and a character, a single character you are to print
5

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,800
this single character according to the number of N  given year, for example, if five and Y then
6

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,870
repeat Y five times, three
7

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,010
And, uh, I forget the symbol,
8

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,700
the symbol name
9

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,260
Let's call it hash, like in programming three and hash then you repeat hash three times.
10

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,470
And so, in this one, you will print a left-angled triangle,
11

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,280
same as here, a five,
12

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,420
then you print to five rows like a left angled triangle here.
13

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,940
And in this one, you are to print it also, but this time it will be facing down.
14

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,210
So for an input like six, you are printing six rows this way.
15

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,810
And in this one, you will print a special average as following you will read an integer N followed by reading N numbers
16

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,030
by reading N the numbers and you have to print 2 values,
17

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,590
The first one is the average of the numbers in odd positions and the second one is the average of the
18

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,030
numbers in even positions.
19

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,180
odd positions are like the first, third, the fifth and so on.
20

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,080
For example, for this input here, six numbers,
21

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,320
these are the six numbers,
22

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,780
We can see that in the odd position we have 10 and 20 and 30,
23

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,730
So the average of them is 20 hear and the average of  100 , 20 and 200 and 600, which are the even positions
24

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:54,790
the average is three hundred, make sure to choose a good data type for an averaging operation, that's
25

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,060
all.
