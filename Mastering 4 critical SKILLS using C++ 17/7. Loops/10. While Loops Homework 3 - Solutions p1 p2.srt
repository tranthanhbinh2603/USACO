00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,490
Let's solve the third homework, the first one is about the find NOs, it isn't a hard one.
1

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,830
All what you need is to figure out that there are eight different ways to make two letters in both cases
2

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,020
lower and upper. For example, it can be
3

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,150
no, No, nO, NO.
4

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,180
But we are considering the four cases for the "no" here and in the other side there is on, oN, On, ON in the
5

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,710
four different cases. They are four, because mathematically you have only two choices and every choice
6

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,430
has two cases.
7

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,300
So overall, like four possible cases. In the future, you will learn much easier ways to that problem.
8

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,570
For example, in the future, you can sort this string input and then make all of it lower then all
9

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,210
what you need to do is just comparing, for example, with one of them only.
10

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,180
But for now, given the current tools, you cannot do that. During the course, you will learn that the
11

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,190
the more programming concepts that you learn, the more different ways that you can do
12

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,340
your tasks in an easier way.
13

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,360
In the second problem, we would like to reverse a number. At this moment, this task should be easy for
14

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,600
you.
15

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,260
We developed several ones in the previous sections.
16

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,790
To do that, we need mainly the %10 and divide by 10 trick.
17

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,760
Remember that %10 gets you the last digit and division by 10 removes for you the last digit.
18

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,580
Now, the only remaining part here, if I have a number like let's say I have numbers like
19

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,000
maybe five, six, seven, how to construct five, six, seven
20

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,930
numbers from them. By doing multiplication and addition of ten, how? let's say we have five, multiply
21

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,710
five by ten.
22

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,900
It is now 50, add the next digit with six, it is now 56.
23

24
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,860
and multiplied by ten.
24

25
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,650
It's five hundred and sixty, add the next digit which is seven.
25

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,480
So mathematically all what we need is a series of multiplication times N and addition of a single digit.
26

27
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,790
That's how we can reverse a number to get a complete new number.
27

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,140
We are reversing it because we are getting it digit by digit from the end of it.
28

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,180
And this is how you construct a number from a group of digits.
29

30
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,260
And this is finally the number, a number of three, the purpose of number of three is to make sure that
30

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,460
you actually did it right.
31

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,570
Yeah, let's stop here.
