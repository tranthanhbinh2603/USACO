00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,900
Let's solve the homework, the first one is straightforward, according to what we learned. Here
1

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,890
we just read the start, read the end and start while loop from this start to this end and every
2

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,060
time we just print the start.
3

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,510
and keep going, very matching to what we learned already. In the second program
4

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,510
We would like to do the repetition, but depending more on the given input.
5

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,510
So to do that, we mainly need to
6

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,090
We need to iterate over the given numbers and start to work over it.
7

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,210
For example, here you read the number and you read the character.
8

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,440
And after that, you start iterating over this number tell it be -1, you can remove this
9

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,050
greater than zero because once it approaches zero, it will be done.
10

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,750
But this is a bit better for readability.
11

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,160
So this is OK, too.
12

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,470
This is mainly the second one, which is also an easy one. In the third problem.
13

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,790
And the fourth one would like to print this triangle, observing here that in the i's row you need
14

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,440
to print like i elements.
15

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,710
Right?
16

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,650
So in the first row, you print once, in the second-row you print twice.
17

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,550
So the relationship here is very straightforward.
18

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,790
That's why we need only two to consider that.
19

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,240
Here we will iterate from row one tell N.
20

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,730
And every time we will have some counter to go up to the row.
21

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,290
So if the row is one will print one star, if the row is two, we print two stars, if the row is three
22

23
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,910
We print three stars and so on.
23

24
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,900
The flipped one has a very similar logic.
24

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,970
We need just to flip the order itself.
25

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:59,040
So here, first of all, we start from the counter row, which is now starting from N now in the first
26

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,160
step, we are actually having N with 5, for example.
27

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,880
Then we print 5 stars, in the second step it will be 4, then we print 4 stars and so on.
28

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,660
So the logic mainly was switching the rows from 1 to N to N to 1.
29

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,440
This mainly be fourth one here. In the final one
30

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,440
We would like to print this special average.
31

32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,280
We did this problem in the past, but it was fixed for six numbers.
32

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,760
Now we have variable number of items.
33

34
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,800
So all we need is to keep in mind which position is even and which position is odd, to do that
34

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,420
We can mainly just consider the position that we are using to iterate.
35

36
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,240
For example, we are reading here the number of Ns. we have the even sum and their count, we have
36

37
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,310
odd sum and their count.
37

38
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,160
And then we keep iterating starting from 1, and with every step we need to figure out is it even
38

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,670
position, if so added to the even part and counter the even, is it odd number added to the odd part and
39

40
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,070
increment the odd counter.
40

41
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,260
Once we are done, we have the odd sum, odd count, even sum and even count, that's all.
