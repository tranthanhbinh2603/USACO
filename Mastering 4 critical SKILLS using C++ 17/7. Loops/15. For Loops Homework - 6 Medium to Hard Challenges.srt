1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:10,980
Let's do more homework on looping also because it's a very critical topic. the first homework is you
1

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,620
are to print an X as following.
2

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,320
So you are reading an N, which would be always odd, and you are to print something like that,
3

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:28,530
And then another thing like that. find a special pair, you are
4

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,830
to count how many numbers X and Y such that X in the following range and Y, also in the given
5

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,220
range.
6

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,280
And you are to make sure that X < Y and X + Y is divisible by 7.
7

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,680
More harder, you are to count all quadruples, the word quadruples refers to something that is 4.
8

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,220
So you would like to count all 4 numbers with the following conditions,
9

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,350
All of them are < 200,
10

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,370
And a + b == c + d.
11

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
You can easily code
12

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,450
It with 4 loops, but try to code it using 3 loops and in the future, you will learn something in data
13

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,160
structures,
14

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,060
called hash tables.
15

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,900
You can do it with two loops only in the far future.
16

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,200
Is Prime, you are to read an integer N, which is < 500 and Print YES; if it's a prime
17

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,270
number, otherwise no.
18

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,260
So remember, a prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and can't be formed by multiplying
19

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,240
2 smaller numbers.
20

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,360
For example, it cannot be divisible with something that is smaller than it, except 1.
21

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,880
So the first few numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on
22

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,390
So if I give you 13, this is yes, a prime number.
23

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,600
If I give you 12,
24

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:51,580
This isn't a prime number because 12 is divisible by 2 and divisible by 6, which are like less
25

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,150
than it.
26

27
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,820
Print primes is a similar one,
27

28
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,680
You're just going now to print the primes, so if I give you 18 year to print all the prime numbers
28

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:09,260
that are < 18, when you are printing,  make sure please that there is no comma printed after the last
29

30
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,510
number, you are to print them comma separated,
30

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,010
No comma after the last number.
31

32
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,890
Digits sum in range, you are going to read 3 numbers N, A, and B, you are to print the summation
32

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,460
of the numbers between 1 and N,
33

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
Whose sum of digits is between A and B. Let's give an example,
34

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,040
Let's say that you read 20 and the sum of digits that we are targeting should be between 2 and
35

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,430
5.
36

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:47,030
So now here, the numbers whose sum of digits are between 2 and 5 and this from 1 to
37

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,320
20 would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and so on.
38

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,570
For example, let's say that you took number like 13.
39

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,950
The sum of digits is just 4, which is between 2 and 5. 
40

41
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,090
20, the sum of digits is just 2, which is between 2 and 5, and so on.
41

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,280
So you are actually iterating from 1 to N verifying that the sum of digits is just between the A and
42

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,550
B.
43

44
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,600
That's it.
