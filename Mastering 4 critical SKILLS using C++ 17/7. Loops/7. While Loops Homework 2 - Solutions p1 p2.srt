00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,440
Let's solve the second homework set in the first problem we need to print the diamond one and to
1

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,900
be able to solve this problem, you need to focus on the relationship between the number of spaces and
2

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,310
the number of stars per line.
3

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,890
So let's first of all, start with recording some data.
4

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,080
If you try to think about, say, N=4 in rule number one, we have three spaces then one
5

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:36,070
star, then two spaces, three stars, then one space, five stars, then zero spaces, seven stars.
6

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,990
So this is the overall statistics that we can find per row.
7

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,660
Now, I would like to think about what kind of relationship
8

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:48,990
we have so far? What kind of formula that we have?
9

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,250
It seems the spaces are typically (N -  rows).
10

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,520
For example, if you are in row one, observe here both of them always seem to be 4, one plus
11

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,390
three is four.
12

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,870
2+2=4, 3+1=4, and  0+4=4.
13

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,610
So N - the current row is enough to get this one.
14

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,290
And this is a straightforward one.
15

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,270
The second one, if you are good in math, it should be easy also to get. Observe
16

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,630
the equation is two times row - one, that's all.
17

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,270
For example, if the row is three, 3 * 2 = 6, 6 - 1 = 5,Here 4 * 2 = 8
18

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,220
8 - 1 = 7
19

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,820
So based on these two equations, we can easily for every row, print according to that number of spaces
20

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,660
and then according to that number of stars, so here we start our for loop and then according to that,
21

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,460
we iterate once (N -  row) to print the spaces and then (2 * row - 1) to print the stars.
22

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,590
Now to do the opposite triangle.
23

24
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,110
All that we need is just mainly to switch, iterating from 1 to N to N to 1.
24

25
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,040
That's all.
25

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,670
Nothing else.
26

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,030
For the second problem, we would like to print the special multiples here, so let's see how can
27

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,600
we do that?
28

29
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,490
It's very straightforward to do it.
29

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,930
Let's see here in the first program here we are iterating.
30

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,870
I think there are two solutions.
31

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,350
... , let's start with that one.
32

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,410
... , here we would like to figure out all the numbers that are divisible by
33

34
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,870
8 or divisible by both 4 and the 3 to solve this problem, we are just iterating here from
34

35
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,200
8.
35

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,750
And then all of what we need is to do the condition.
36

37
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,520
Is it divisible by 8?
37

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,270
Yes.
38

39
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,810
Or is it divisible by both 3 and 4?
39

40
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,620
Yes.
40

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,370
Then we are done.
41

42
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,320
So if these two conditions are achieved.
42

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,020
We are done with that.
43

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,510
This is mainly all what we need in this simple problem.
