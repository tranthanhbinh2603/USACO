00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,890
To solve the multiplication table, you should get a sense of nested loops here, you have for every item
1

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,950
in this column one, then for every item in column two, whenever you have this is for every and for
2

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,590
every, then you are dealing mainly with something that is nested. To do that,
3

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,150
Here, we are going to make something that iterate over every row then something
4

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,660
that iterate over every column.
5

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,920
So we have here count_n and we have count_m, the count_n start here with one and for every count_n
6

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,650
we start a count_m with one and we keep doing the two numbers then for every loop, we print it.
7

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,760
So the moral of that is to get the sense of when we should use nested loops
8

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
like that.
9

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,400
In the last one here, the special sum, which is an example of three nested loops, we need one nested
10

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,100
loop to do the number of the cases and then another nested loop to read the n integers.
11

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,100
But in every case, you need to loop also to do this kind of repetition.
12

13
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,460
Yeah.
13

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,960
Let's see how to implement that.
14

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,070
Three nested loops,
15

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,530
Test case, reading numbers, and the repetition to K times.
16

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,700
Here we iterate over the number of the cases, then we start to iterate over the number of n to read
17

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,630
the n values.
18

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,820
And we have here a sum variable to sum all of the itemsfor us.
19

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,840
And it's very important here.
20

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,060
This is the third loop.
21

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,040
Now, in every step, we iterate K times.
22

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,730
So the current depth first would be one, then two and three and four.
23

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,400
If, for example, it is four, then we will loop four times and keep repeating multiplying the value
24

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,950
four times, which is computing the power of the number, once we are done with the result of the current
25

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,860
step, we just add it to the total sum and so on.
26

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,340
So this is, again, another example of how to get the sense of multiple loops.
