00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,200
In case you wonder why to learn programming or why C++, I would like to share with you some of my thoughts.
1

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,260
First of all, learning programming sharpens your problem-solving skills.
2

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,290
This is a bit similar to mathematics.
3

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,170
When you practice math, your math
4

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,080
solving skills is growing up. In a similar way,
5

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,510
programming has some kind of connection, something that we call "the problem solving" or "computational
6

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,400
solving" skills.
7

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,350
And what is more sensible for you might be real-life applications, like, you have a lot of applications on
8

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,140
your mobile.
9

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,390
And you might think that I would like to build my small application or so.
10

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,970
When you learn programming, you have a much better chance in understanding the technologies that are
11

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,150
around you, and understanding some of the logic behind building them.
12

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,290
Generally speaking, in our career, we are one of the highest-paid guys.
13

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,210
So this might be also one good reason for you to learn programming.
14

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,400
And it is really fun, and many, many kids even enjoy it.
15

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,430
There is one of the interesting things in programming.
16

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,090
The programming competitions like ICPC for guys in university and IOI
17

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,360
for younger guys. It is really much fun, a lot of connections to build and travel.
18

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,340
You might also have a dream to work in big companies like Google and Facebook.
19

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,990
So, programming is your way to that.
20

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,930
About C++ itself. C++ is a really powerful programming language.
21

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,460
It has a lot of paradigms.
22

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,450
If I have to describe the language in a single word, I will say it's complex.
23

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,660
C++ language is really a huge programming language, and this is a great opportunity to learn a lot about
24

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,800
programming concepts.
25

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,800
Also, the language is scalable, fast, and portable.
26

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,290
It gives you a lot of control over hardware-level things which isn't available in other programming languages.
27

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,160
One of the most usage scenarios for C++ is when it comes to high performance, when you have to do a
28

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,330
lot of things very fast.
29

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,380
That is why C++ is in the industry and will remain there because there are some kind of applications
30

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,070
that C++ is the core player in them.
31

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,470
Fairly enough, C++ isn't the most important language among the programming languages,
32

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,460
it exists.
33

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,430
It's a fundamental part of the market, but it's still very critical  to learn. As an educational language,
34

35
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,970
C++ is one of the best programming languages to learn.
35

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,490
I'm still, like, 12 years so far and
36

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,230
I'm still telling my students this is the best language to start learning with.
37

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,180
An interesting thing about C++ is that when you learn it, and you come to move to other programming languages,
38

39
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,180
you will find it a very smooth process, but you will find the reverse isn't true. To some extent,
39

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,240
C++ is like a superset of C, it also has similarities with Java and C#. These are other programming languages.
40

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,150
To some extent, C++ is ranked somewhere between three to six, among many other indexing websites.
41

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,790
A little bit about the history of C++,
42

43
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,580
let's call what is before C++ 2011, the classical C++.
43

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,920
This represents the core syntax of C++. In C++11,
44

45
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,750
there was like a very big jump in additions and in syntax to C++, making the language really look
45

46
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,630
like a very modern programming language.
46

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,940
C++14 is more like refining to C++11. You can think of 14 like, this is where 11 should be,
47

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,890
but we need time to improve things.
48

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,320
C++17 and 20 and so on,
49

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,430
every one of them should be like one further enhancement to the language.
50

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,260
Since C++11, every three years we have, like, one round to change the language.
51

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,790
So three years, 14, three years, 17, three years, 20. We expect the next will be 23,
52

53
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,470
26 and so on.
53

54
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,310
OK, so one relevant concern here about programming, like, who could learn programming and how hard is that?
54

55
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,750
Programming,
55

56
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,100
it doesn't need math.
56

57
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,000
So if I don't know math or I'm not good at mathematics, I still can learn programming.
57

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,010
You notice now, kids everywhere are learning programming.
58

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,380
Here is what you need to know.
59

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,970
Learning programming is very, very close to learning a new, different human language that is a bit
60

61
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,140
very far from your language.
61

62
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,970
Like, for example, if you are coming from an Arabic or English background and trying to learn
62

63
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,900
Chinese. There is a gap in symbols and in the structure of the language.
63

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,070
It will take time.
64

65
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,350
So in the beginning, it's typically a bit weird.
65

66
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,090
But once you get it, get used to it, then everything is OK.
66

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,430
I would say everyone has to pass with these three stages.
67

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,840
You are very confused
68

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,110
in the beginning, you would like to, like, just burn your computer and then everything gets in the right
69

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,500
track.
70

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,690
So, take it easy.
71

72
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,030
Understand that the beginning is typically hard.
72

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,210
One of the unique things in this course is that a lot of my students highlighted that they
73

74
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,710
found that learning programming is a bit easier in my own style.
74

75
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,880
That is it.
