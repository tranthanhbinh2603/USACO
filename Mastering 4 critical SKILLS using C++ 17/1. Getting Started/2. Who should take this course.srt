00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,170
There are three-audience for this course. The first type of guys who have no programming background 
1

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,920
at all. There are no assumptions in this course at all.
2

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,870
I started from the very fundamentals and the very basics.
3

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,530
This course is going to save your time because the course has very short lectures.
4

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,290
I intend to make it very, very, very direct to the point. I avoid making the content very long and
5

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,060
repetitive, just to have like, "Oh, this course looks like a forty hours course".
6

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,720
It's just, to the point. I also focus on the skills.
7

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,080
So after you finish the course, you will not have to take another course to maybe enhance your information and your skills.
8

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:48,510
The other case, for the course is the following, it is very common for guys to have a programming course
9

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,750
if they enjoy it, but they discover after the course that they have weak skills.
10

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,580
This is very visible (when it comes to developing medium to large projects).
11

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,660
So, they discover that the overall-quizzes and overall-challenges were really very basic.
12

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,390
Also, sometimes even in different courses, the information sometimes is outdated or even missing important details.
13

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,220
So, sometimes you still have to take another course to enhance what is missing.
14

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,410
The third case, which is a bit tricky, if someone is already a good programmer, maybe have like ten
15

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,880
ten years of experience,
16

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,680
but he would like to do some refreshing on concepts, In this case-
17

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,180
maybe my course would be helpful.
18

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,190
For example, maybe some of the modern topics covered in the course, maybe an added value.
19

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,000
The best way is to just proceed with the content. Check it out and decide if this might be or is suitable for you
20

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,470
or not.
21

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,770
That is All. :)
