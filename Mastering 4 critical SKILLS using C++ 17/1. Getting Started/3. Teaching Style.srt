00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,780
The course has a bit specific teaching style, so I thought it worth sharing with you. 
1

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,770
There are definitely a lot and a lot of complaints about other courses here or in universities.
2

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,150
So from my experience, I learned a lot about how to teach things.
3

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,550
The first thing is to know I usually differentiate between the major concepts and minor concepts.
4

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,670
Normally, courses are explained like unit by unit, explaining the complete concepts of a specific unit
5

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,710
with all of its details, which typically involve a lot of major and minor concepts.
6

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,290
And these minor concepts typically just cause a lot of puzzling for the students.
7

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,190
In my case, you would find me explaining some major concepts in a unit and delaying some of the concepts
8

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,130
to another round.
9

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,260
For example, you will notice that there is a unit named "More on Fundamentals".
10

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,950
It's like number twenty-four or so in the content.
11

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,710
So even in something like after twenty-four units, I'm going back to explain some
12

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,410
of the very basic and the very fundamentals of the course.
13

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,930
The reason behind that is they aren't mandatory at all.
14

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,410
You can skip them for a lot of time and focus on the major concepts.
15

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,370
So be careful from that. I delay concepts.
16

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,200
I intended to do that.
17

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,550
You also find me usually going directly to the point with practice.
18

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,550
So this is more of a bottom-up style.
19

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,170
Like, I go directly to the point that I would like to explain, typically highlighting some syntax and
20

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,640
then in between, highlighting the needed theory.
21

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,610
So it's more of very practical and this fits more with programming.
22

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,540
The other very critical point when it comes to showing the code, there are two styles.
23

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,780
The very common one is, live-coding style, where someone is starting to write the code line by line
24

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,520
in front of you.
25

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,490
This is very good from the engaging point of view,
26

27
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,070
but there are a few drawbacks.
27

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,980
For example, the content is usually longer than necessary.
28

29
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,360
Also, sometimes there are mistakes.
29

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,680
So, one has to make editings, which might be not suitable for everyone. On the other side,
30

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,410
The way that I go with it is ready-code snippets.
31

32
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,430
You would find me always pasting a picture here with the whole content directly, and I'm just explaining 
32

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,630
it.
33

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,100
The advantage of that is really fast and the content is clear. The lecture
34

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,410
that is five minutes in code snippets might be like 12 in the live-coding style.
35

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,420
There is a single disadvantage with that.
36

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,760
To some extent, it might be less engaging than the other style.
37

38
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,890
You cannot gain the advantage of everything. You will not find
38

39
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,980
the lecture is short and still is live-coding style.
39

40
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,900
This is very rare and very hard to achieve.
40

41
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,410
So this is my way. This is how I see myself saving my time and other guys' time.
41

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,050
Also, most of the time I have this strategy like I explain something. I try to administrate
42

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,230
something through some easy to medium, sometimes hard to practice.
43

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,290
And this is typically followed by a homework.
44

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,740
So this should be like a common style during the whole content.
That is it. :)
