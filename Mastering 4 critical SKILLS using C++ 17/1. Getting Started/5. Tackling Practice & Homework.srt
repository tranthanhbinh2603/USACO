00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,360
One of the key aspects of this course is the amount of practice and homework relative to others.
1

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,120
There is only one way to build the skills.
2

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,800
And as people say: "Practice just Makes Perfect". As a teacher,
3

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,870
this is actually a two-edged sword.
4

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,930
Some students might like the idea that they have a lot of homework and they have a lot of practice,
5

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,510
so they are enjoying and learning, however.
6

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,470
And I had like thousands of my students during my career, many other students might get frustrated
7

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,910
for failing to solve the homework or the practice.
8

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,380
And this kind of guys would typically leave like one out of five stars with some comment.
9

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,380
So, like,  it would be a risk for a teacher to provide more and more homework and have more frustrated 
10

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:48,880
students.
11

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:57,030
However, as someone with a passion for teaching, I really think I should take the risk. In many
12

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,800
other courses,
13

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,630
this might be cheated with just easy challenges.
14

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,450
But for me, I think the right way is to challenge you.
15

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,530
There is also another classical mistake when courses are very smooth in their explanation and
16

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,390
their examples and the students suddenly find that the homework is really very hard.
17

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,650
So, you would always find most of my lectures have a fair amount of practice first, then amount of homework
18

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,700
to solve this problem.
19

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,080
Now, I hope you hear to understand that when you come to tackle something that's hard, there
20

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
will be a high failure rate,
21

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,930
and this is very natural.
22

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,620
And everyone that you see successful in his career has already tackled a lot of hard problems and has already
23

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,450
failed a lot.
24

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,600
So,
25

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:50,300
you will notice the following, with most of the topics there are practice and the practice will be ranging
26

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,170
from easy to hard.
27

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,560
And this is mainly you will find it very common in the fundamental part
28

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,180
and in the (OOP) part.  I advise you before I explain the solution to stop the video, challenge yourself and
29

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,320
then listen to my solution.
30

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,770
And remember, you will have hard problems. In a similar way when it comes to the homework, you will
31

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:17,510
find easy to hard homework with my solutions. When it comes to the projects, I'm trying to provide like
32

33
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,850
a wide, diverse range of projects for you.
33

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,470
But again, many students might find it very problematic to start the project.
34

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,630
Now, how to handle the difficulties of that? When it comes to the medium and the hard challenges,
35

36
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,020
you will typically fail.
36

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,870
This is intended. I heard that from hundreds of my students.
37

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,730
There are two types of failures.
38

39
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,580
One failure is to fail to solve the problem.
39

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,550
But however, when you try to understand my solution, you manage to understand it, it might be a bit difficult,
40

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,360
but it could happen.
41

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,530
There is a case that is harder for the students and causes more frustrations that when you try to solve,
42

43
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,930
you fail and you try to understand my solution,
43

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,680
you also fail.
44

45
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,720
So many, many students just run away at this stage or get very frustrated.
45

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
I would like you to know that in most of the cases, if you fail to solve the practice and homework,
46

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,960
even if you drop the practice and homework, you can proceed from lecture to another.
47

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,400
In other words, if you failed to understand or even didn't like to solve a practice or homework of a specific topic,
48

49
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,310
you can always move to the next topic.
49

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm making sure of the dependencies, to minimize them as much as I could.
50

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,210
OK, so how now to handle this hard homework?  How to be good?
51

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,100
This approach is something I learned in my life.
52

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,060
It is for this course and you can utilize it in many other things.
53

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,760
Give, first of all, a serious trial to what you are trying to solve as a practice as a homework.
54

55
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,470
I suggest something on average to be ~30 minutes, maybe 45, maybe 60.
55

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,870
There are two types of students, some of them who get bored after like five minutes of thinking, this
56

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,500
is very wrong.
57

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
You have to push up your skills up to 30 minutes.
58

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,220
And some of them like to keep tackling a problem like hours and hours.
59

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,000
But this isn't very practical because there is a huge amount of content in the course of study. After you tackle
60

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,410
a problem for like 30 minutes,
61

62
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,580
check out my solution,
62

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,700
even if you solved the problem. You will find usually my code is smarter and shorter than yours.
63

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,290
One of the common mistakes is to skip my solution because you think "Oh! I anyway solved it .".
64

65
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,970
No. Wait, wait a second.
65

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,560
My solution is intended.
66

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,700
You have to read it.
67

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,890
You have to put an effort in understanding it.
68

69
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,890
And this is part of your educational experience.
69

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,750
My code is
70

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,260
typically smarter and shorter
71

72
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,090
and there is a lot to learn from it.
72

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,260
So, don't skip it.
73

74
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,060
Put effort in understanding my solution, this would be very valuable.
74

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,690
What if you even couldn't understand the solution, as simple as, you are going to put what you couldn't solve
75

76
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,880
in your to-do-list. Keep going in the course and come back later.
76

77
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,920
And here is a surprising part,
77

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,670
you will notice that for some of what you couldn't solve, you now manage to solve it, and some
78

79
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,460
of what was really hard,
79

80
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,610
you manage now to understand more about it.
80

81
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,010
The more you go in the course and you go back again, you will find yourself
81

82
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,830
managing to solve more and more of the hard difficulties.
82

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,370
Even it could happen that you move to next courses in your career and you come back later and you solve
83

84
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,280
more and more of them.
84

85
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,510
So consider them as open challenges that you have to keep coming back and trying them and so on.
85

86
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,510
Please, Don't run away from the course because you find it hard.
86

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,610
And please be fair when it comes to rating the course, don't just like give me like (one star) because
87

88
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,370
you failed to solve something.
88

89
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,200
This is intended and this is expected.
89

90
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,960
And I met many of my students who eventually managed to solve most of the content. That is it. :)
