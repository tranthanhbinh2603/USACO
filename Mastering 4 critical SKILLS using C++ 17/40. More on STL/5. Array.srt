1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:10,530
One of the new data structures in the standard library is the array of reckless you see here with the

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,140
final array and you give it a type and you give it also affects at length value.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,400
Remember the temperatures tied for the parameters here.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,450
You give it also a number.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,480
So internally, this is just wrapping internally, affix its size array.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,510
So the point here is the target of this array to be a replacement to the belt and fix it array from

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,300
the sea and it doesn't use any extra memory.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
So you are okay here, initializing it with a list of three, four, five, one, two.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,910
And then if you call a redesign is going to give you five, you can now normally change the value array

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,610
or that at or specific array position which is handling the exception.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,310
If you try to access out of the world, you can also sort it normally you can assign it to somebody.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,780
So if you are assigned it this way, the last elements will be zeros.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,900
If you try to initialize it was numbers that are the more five, it will give you a comparison error.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:19,770
If you want to get the internal array which is created, it just you can get the pointer here and plus

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,580
seventeen.

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,850
If you would like to omit these two things together, then you can just remove them and is going to

17
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,070
recognize all these are double numbers and also just like double and two, which make our life easier.

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
The purpose of the array is to be a replacement to the fix the system error rate.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,370
So please stick to it if you would like to use a normal rate.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,420
The.
