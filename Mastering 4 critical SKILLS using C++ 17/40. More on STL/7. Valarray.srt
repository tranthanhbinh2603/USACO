1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:09,110
The array is a container with a very focus on meth operation, sequential, linear, on some data structure,

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,440
some people doesn't like it, like the design of it is a bit not the best, but still nice to know about

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:16,580
it.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,590
So let's say that we have here an array of numbers.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,030
You can create a wide array of this array by saying that.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,610
And five, it is the first track noticed.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,570
It isn't like vectors.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,290
You see that and.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,940
And this is a bad thing.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,170
So it is.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,130
It is one and five which is taking five numbers.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,900
So it is the first interesting thing you can call the absolute value over, over, over, over.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,600
The vast array is going to apply absolute value over every element which is going to make every element

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,330
you're just supposed to that you can see just the summit, which is going to sum all of the values.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,070
Now, if you try to say something like two times, V1 plus two is going element by element, some them

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,820
and multiply over all of them by two and return a new vector.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,990
So this is an element twice abberation rootsier V two is just a street value.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,480
So we want to be two is going to do what is going to

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,070
plus one and one is two and two minus two is zero.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,670
Three plus three is six times to be six.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,150
Four minus four is going to be zero, five is going to be zero.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,530
Now you have here a new vector element.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,950
Twice you can say something like we want equal equal V two.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,760
So the result would be one zero one zero zero.

25
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,280
Uh.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,260
If we say the year one and one plus one.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,520
I doubt that this is one zero one zero zero.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh, sorry, this is about the three, so what do you want to be able to say?

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,640
It is correct.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,810
So if we try to compare V1 and V2 with equality, one is one to minus two equal to Foldes three, three,

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,800
two, minus three, minus four by four is false.

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,180
Minus five and five is false.

33
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,670
So you see, you get a very low rate here of every element.

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,640
Now you can say the men and max, which is going to give you the minimum, is zero and the maximum will

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,540
be one.

36
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,460
Let's define a new Valory of four.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,340
That is this way.

38
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,410
Zero one, two, three, four.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,850
You can do something like two times V five plus one, which is going to multiply every single element

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,830
with two and then add one for them to two times.

41
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:55,020
The plus one is one two times one plus one is three times two plus one is five times the three plus

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:03,450
one is seven as you see is more of a very math operation, like a whole sequence of numbers.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,660
Let's see some nice functions about the lower function.

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,880
You can do something like about two and five and then even you can call the good sum.

45
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,790
So it is what's going to happen the way that every element in V five would be to talk about it.

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,400
So V five is zero.

47
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:19,950
One, two, three.

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,290
It would be two to the zero to the one to the two to the three and all of that, some 250.

49
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,740
Now you can reverse it V five and two.

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,350
So now every element of the five will be squared zero to the to one or two to the war, two, three

51
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,460
to the two and so on.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,140
You can also do something like on the fly two times to be five and six.

53
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,840
Again, the same logic, but it is a catch.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,750
You cannot here have something temporary like that.

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,560
You can have it for the first argument, but you can't have it to the second enemy.

56
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,160
You need to take this in a battery first and then apply it.

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,290
As you see, it is very math operation for the guys who are doing some math application.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,460
That's it.
