00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,980
In this video, I would like to show a simulation for the usage of the system.
1

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,470
The user is faced with 10 choices here and then a menu request from 1 to 10.
2

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,390
I started to get the choice of 1, 1 1, 1, 1.
3

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,970
I'm feeding information.
4

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,550
So with every 1, I'm adding a book,
5

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,670
The book has a name, has an ID, has a total quantity.
6

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,740
There are three inputs from the user.
7

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,430
So the user here entered the input ID: 100,  name: "Math4" and there is 3.
8

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,540
The one who is entering this data is the admin. So entered
9

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 books.
10

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,570
And then we give a choice of 4, 4
11

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,880
Here is printing the whole library but by ID.
12

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,960
So now the whole library will be printed in this order and notice here it's by ID, name, then quantity.
13

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,510
But the IDs here are sorted in inputs and these are the current quantity and there is no borrowing
14

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,640
for this book at the moment.
15

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,320
I can also enter 5, to order them by name.
16

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,230
So now you see what is ordered
17

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560
now here is name, "Math1"
18

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,340
"Math2", "Math3", "Math4", "Programming1", "Programming2".
19

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,970
Now we have a different ordering at the moment.
20

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,290
Proceeding more, I entered input 6, input 6 is for adding a user, to add a user, you need to add
21

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,250
a name for him and I new ID.
22

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,420
So again, we entered 1 user, 2, 3, 4. 4 names only.
23

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,180
Now we entered 7,
24

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,270
7 is user want to borrow a specific book.
25

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,270
So I would like to enter two things,
26

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,400
What is the user name and what is the book name?
27

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,530
It seems that Mostafa borrowed that one.
28

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,780
And "Math2", and "Math3". "Ali", "Math1" and "Math2". "Noha" "Math1" and "Math2". now enter again choice
29

30
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,590
number 4 to print the whole library.
30

31
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,700
You will start to notice that "Math2" is borrowed three times.
31

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,870
By whom?
32

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,970
If you try to investigate,
33

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,630
here is "Math2" by "Ali", here is "Math2" by "Noha", here is "Math2" by "Mostafa".
34

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,810
So yes, this book has been borrowed three times. from another data perspective you might print
35

36
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,560
the users,
36

37
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,230
So here we start to see the user
37

38
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,910
"Mostafa" has this ID and borrowed books 101, 102, 103.
38

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,250
So now you see here our information has been reflected in different other operations.
39

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,210
It seems that this user, "Ashraf", has has no borrowing so far.
40

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,250
If we enter the choice 2, we are going to search by a book prefix, so now we would like to find
41

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,570
all the books that start with two letters, "ma".
42

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,090
So we have "Math4", 2, 1, 3. Another search with the word "pro" , show "programming1", "programming2".
43

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,740
If I entered something like "machine" for machine learning books,
44

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,130
There are no books with such a prefix. Choice
45

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,760
number 3 is who borrowed a specific book.
46

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,330
We entered "math1" we want to know which users borrowed
47

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,280
this book, it is going to print that "Mostafa", "Ali", "Noha" borrowed this book. in a similar way,
48

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
Who borrowed "Math2"? "Mostafa", "Ali" and "Noha".
49

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,850
Who borrowed "machine"?
50

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,440
There are no books with this name,
51

52
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,570
This is an invalid name. 4, let's print now the system.
52

53
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,510
The system is, as we showed before, in this way.
53

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,500
Let's now print the users we already saw that. we would like now to test the feature number 8.
54

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Feature number 8 is returning a book.
55

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,200
So we saying that "Mostafa" is returning "Math1".
56

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:31,680
And you see here that "Math1" is borrowed three times and "Mustafa" really borrowed "Math1" here,
57

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,290
102, after this operation,
58

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:43,920
if we tried to print again the library, we will notice that the  "Math1" quantity decreased
59

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,010
here, the borrowed one.
60

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,680
So you notice here 2, but you notice here 3.
61

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,330
So the book is returned.
62

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,610
If we printed, the users will notice that "Mostafa" doesn't have "Math1" anymore.
63

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,470
So you see how the system is integral over all, the data is correct.
64

65
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,640
That's all.
