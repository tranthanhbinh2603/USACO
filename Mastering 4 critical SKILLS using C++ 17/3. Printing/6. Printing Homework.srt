00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,500
In this video, we will have our first real homework about printing. One of the main promises in this course 
1

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,450
is that you gain a lot of skills. And the way that you will gain these skills is mainly through
2

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,980
solving and practicing a lot,
3

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,230
comparing your solution with the provided solution. Homework will be ranging from easy to 
4

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,540
hard.
5

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,140
So take it easy when it comes to hard problems and don't get disappointed. In the first program,
6

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,130
you are giving this simple program. You are requested to trace it.
7

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,890
So, line by line, go over it and decide what would be printed in the runtime.
8

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,020
In your second program, you write something to print this triangle using Asterix '*' and spaces.
9

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,590
This is another triangle in homework 3. And homework 4,
10

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,810
it is more like a diamond.
11

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,800
So these are your four homework.
12

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,480
Finally, you are to identify all the possible errors that you can find in this code, 
13

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,050
fix all of them.
14

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,130
You will find the code inside the unit.
15

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,620
So download it and start to fix one by one.
16

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,030
That is it. :)
