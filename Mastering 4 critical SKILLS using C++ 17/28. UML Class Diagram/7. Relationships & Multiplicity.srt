00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,410
Let's put the relationships and multiplicity together. Thinking about this diagram,
1

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:12,080
we have a university that is composed of departments, and the department is aggregated of professors.
2

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,660
Sorry, the department is aggregated of professors.
3

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,890
The logic here is if the university got closed, there is no meaning for a department without the university,
4

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,210
but if some departments got closed, professors will remain professors.
5

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,050
So that's why this aggregation,
6

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,160
but this is a composition.
7

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,900
By the way, we can read always the relationship in the two directions
8

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,810
as I said before like the university has departments, or a department belongs to a single
9

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,100
university, and so on.
10

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,410
So now thinking about the multiplicity. Now, the department would belong to a single university.
11

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:49,760
Right?
12

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,000
You see here the one
13

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,170
so there is a consistency here that you should take in mind.
14

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,540
If you said that this is a composition relationship, and you said here that this is zero, for example,
15

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,770
this is contradiction.
16

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,740
If you said it is a composition, it means that these belong only to this university.
17

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,340
That's why typically you will find a one as a multiplicity in terms of the composition. 
18

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,300
In a similar logic,
19

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,040
if you said that this is aggregation, it means a professor may not belong to a department.
20

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,430
So this means that it should have zero.
21

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,320
So as a rule, you typically put one beside a black diamond, and there is typically some zero beside
22

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,600
the empty diamond.
23

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,230
So consistency is important.
24

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,990
Here is a bigger example of a shopping cart example. We have here a user,
25

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,240
there are two types of user,
26

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
administrator is a user, customer is a user.
27

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
So this is inheritance relationship.
28

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Here we have the common features and variables, and we have the non-common features and variables.
29

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,570
You see that the customer has a shopping cart, and there is an aggregation, so you see here the composition
30

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,570
has one, a composition has one, a composition has one, a composition has one.
31

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,890
This is consistent diagram.
32

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,020
The customer also would have a single order.
33

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,770
Each order might belong to a specific customer,
34

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,500
each customer may have zero or more orders,
35

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,890
each order has also exactly one shipping information.
36

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,810
This is one to one relationship, and this is one to one relationship.
37

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,560
OK, this is one to many relationship.
38

39
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,740
Yeah, These are a bunch of examples. I would like you to think about them in terms of relationships
39

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,230
and multiplicity. Thinking between student and course, the student registers in a course,
40

41
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,330
So this is many to many relationship.
41

42
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,300
This means that a student registered in many courses, and the course attended by many students. Think about
42

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,560
the following in a similar logic.
43

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,800
Customer, bank account, savings account, checking account.
44

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,870
What is the relationship?
45

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,730
Let's say we are modeling a parking lot.
46

47
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,660
We have a vehicle, car, seat, engine, door, driver, passenger, gasoline, garage.
47

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,480
Let's say that these are a bunch of classes in our system.
48

49
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,340
What is a relationship? If we have a google form of question and answer and options, how to model it? 
49

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,090
The computer,
50

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,020
its cpu,
51

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,480
its motherboard, cache, memory, relationships.  Project, project manager, and so on.
52

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Just think of them as an exercise for you. That's it.
