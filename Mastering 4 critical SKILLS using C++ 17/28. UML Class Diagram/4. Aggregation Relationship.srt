Let's learn more about the aggregation relationship. So the aggregation relationship is a weak
1

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,100
relationship, and there is no ownership in the relationship.
2

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,010
This means that the whole doesn't own the part like in the composition the car owned the engine,
3

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,780
...
4

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,740
It's own one,
5

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,610
here it doesn't exist.
6

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,440
Let's say that the department has some professors.
7

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,710
If the department is shut down, they are still professors, they still exist.
8

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,750
So in this set o terms of code, the whole class or some other class can create the part
9

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,360
object,
10

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,540
and if the whole object is destroyed, the part may still be in use by others.
11

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,730
This is a critical difference in semantics and in coding style.
12

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,150
So you can think here, this empty diamond is how we express aggregation.
13

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:05,570
This means a magazine is composed of articles, but the article can exist even without being at all
14

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,030
like being specific to a specific magazine,
15

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,500
and so on. So this is mainly what the aggregation relationship means.
