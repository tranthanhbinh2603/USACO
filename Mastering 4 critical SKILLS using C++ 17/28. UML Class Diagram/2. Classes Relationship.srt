00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,640
Classes relationships, we definitely have in our system too many classes, and these classes have some
1

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,200
relationships among them. There are four types of relationships.
2

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,460
The first type of relationships are normal relationships, just like, say, user and a book, and the relationship
3

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,890
in the systems that the user is going to borrow a book.
4

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,020
So they are two different entities,
5

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,480
but it happened that there is some connection between them, user and an item in his shopping
6

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,290
cart, and so on.
7

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,100
There are also other two types of relationships that follow what we call the has a_pattern.
8

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,540
It's like the following: the department has employees, the car has an engine, the university has departments.
9

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,110
When you think about the semantic, it has this has thing.
10

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,680
So typically if we said a car has an engine, you can think of the car as a whole and the engine as a part.
11

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,420
So it is like a whole-part relationship.
12

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,880
OK, so what's the difference between aggregation and composition?
13

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,570
Both of them are has function.
14

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,150
Composition is a strong relationship,
15

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,790
aggregation is a weaker.
16

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,760
What does it mean?
17

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,050
It means the following: Let's say here in the composition, it means a strong relationship.
18

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,660
Let's say that the university got closed.
19

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,400
What would happen to the departments?
20

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,160
They will also get closed.
21

22
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,710
There is no meaning for a department without its university.
22

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,170
If there is a car, we know it has an engine, and we know that this engine belonged to this specific
23

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,560
car,
24

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,860
and if the car got destroyed for a reason or other in a crash, then the engine doesn't have a meaning.
25

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,810
So the relationship is very strong between both of them.
26

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,670
On the other side, for the aggregation, the relationship is a bit weaker.
27

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,420
So department has employees,
28

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,690
there could be even employees that don't belong to departments,
29

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,640
and if the department got closed, the employees are still there.
30

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,210
So although there is some whole-part relationship, it is of a weak type, then the generalization or
31

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,080
inheritance is a complete topic that we will discuss in OOP,
32

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,710
It is of the is a relationship.
33

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,000
We say that circle is a shape, a bicycle is a vehicle, and so on.
34

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,890
So there is like is a relationship.
35

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,570
You feel it like a parent-child relationship like a circle is a shape,
36

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,790
rectangle is a shape,
37

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,590
triangle is a shape,
38

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,110
It seems like shape is something generic, something general, and there are many types of it.
39

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,610
As you see, composition here is very tight.
40

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,010
Aggregation is less weak, the association is less and less weak.
41

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,280
If the relationship is an aggregation or composition nor generalization, then it's typically just normal
42

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,110
relationship, or even there might be no relationship. In the next
43

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,500
videos, we will discuss more of these relationships types.
44

45
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,820
That's it.
