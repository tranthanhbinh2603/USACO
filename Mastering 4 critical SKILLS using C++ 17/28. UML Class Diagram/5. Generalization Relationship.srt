The generalization relationship is a relationship. When you figure out that there is some is a relationship,
1

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,200
you know there is some generalization or inheritance.
2

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,970
So we say that student is a person,
3

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,740
teacher is a person, dean is a person.
4

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,880
So this is a relationship.
5

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
The is-a has an implication.
6

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,980
It implies that there are some common variables and functions that should exist between a student, teacher, and dean,
7

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,980
and also there should be some unique variables and functions for every one of them.
8

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,610
For example, you can think that all of these people would have a name, all of them would have an email,
9

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,120
all of them would have an address.
10

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,850
So this is what's common between them.
11

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,370
You can think, for example, the student has a GPA, but the dean has a salary,
12

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,800
and so on. Circle is a shape,
13

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,170
rectangle is a shape, triangle is a shape.
14

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,850
We need to draw all of them,
15

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,890
We need to compute the area for all of them,
16

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,600
but the rectangle area computation is different from the circle area computation.
17

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,410
The software engineer is an employee, the manager is an employee, also office boy
18

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:14,070
is an employee. Although there would be some common features between them, there would be definitely
19

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,100
different variables and functions for everyone,
20

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,450
and so on. Apple is a fruit, orange is a fruit of food, watermelon is a fruit. Bicycle, motor, vehicle, and railed vehicle
21

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,370
are all of them a vehicle, and so on.
22

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,240
In terms of UML, we use this empty triangle. So let's say we are in a bank, modeling a bank,
23

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,530
then we can have a checking account, savings account, credit account,
24

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,080
but all of them are eventually accounts,  there should be something common between them.
25

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,850
Here is a bigger hierarchy where we have a mammal is as an animal, and also we have a horse as a mammal.
26

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,390
So you see the relationship can get bigger.
27

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,520
Let's see an example we were building the composition with the generalization.
28

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,250
We have a vehicle which could be water or road,
29

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,010
the road vehicle could be bicycle or a car,
30

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,860
the car is composed of an engine and of four wheels.
31

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,270
This how UML might start to grow up with different relationships. That's it.
