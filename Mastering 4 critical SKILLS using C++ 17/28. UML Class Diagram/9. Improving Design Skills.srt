Many students complained about the design skills, and how to improve them, so I would like to share with
1

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,590
you a tip from my personal experience.
2

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,080
First of all, remember something skills takes time.
3

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,660
There is no course that teaches you skills, the only way to teach in courses is knowledge.
4

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,660
So how to gain skills? Through practice.
5

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,550
That's why this course emphasizes a lot of homework and projects.
6

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,810
So don't feel bad if you cannot design your project from the first step.
7

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,760
This is very natural and very normal.
8

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,040
Remember, for example, the class diagram.
9

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,930
The class diagram helps you to see the big picture.
10

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,110
One way to improve the design skills and seeing the big picture and all of the details is as follows:
11

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,260
Before coding anything, you start to sketch your initial UML diagram.
12

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,410
This means you think about the potential class diagrams, the relationships between them, the multiplicity
13

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,500
between them, and some of the major features like variables and functions, and so on.
14

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,650
Once you're done with that, start coding your system.
15

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,020
There is a common observation here.
16

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,580
You will notice there are a lot that is missing, critical variables, and functions.
17

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,130
You will notice also some classes were wrong, some relationships were wrong, or some multiplicity was wrong.
18

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,520
This is OK.
19

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,780
Once you are done with your project, redraw your final UML diagram.
20

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,680
Start to compare your initial diagram with your final diagram.
21

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Ask yourself why I missed this thing, why I missed this class, and through the answer of why, you will
22

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,460
notice what got wrong in your thinking process. Iteratively, you will learn from your mistakes this
23

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,360
way, and you will realize that you became a good designer
24

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,690
when you bridge the gap between your first and last diagram. You will never have your first diagram
25

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,920
like your last diagram,
26

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,810
but what is a gap between them?
27

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,090
If it is a small gap, then you became a good designer and have good design skills. That it.
