This video will be like a demo for how to read from a file in eclipse.
1

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,140
So here we wrote our code that's going to read from this file.
2

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,620
So let's take it here and let's create a file right-click here on the project.
3

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,930
new and then you select the file.
4

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,270
You give it a name and.
5

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,370
That's it going for you.
6

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,040
Let's try 10, 20 now.
7

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,570
Our code is ready to read in this file and write in this file, which doesn't exist at the moment.
8

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,100
So let's just run this code.
9

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,900
After we run it, the file is created here, but you may not see it, so you come here maybe and
10

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,670
refresh the project you see now here my output file is 30.
11

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,160
Sometimes you see the output file is empty.
12

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,680
If this is the case, you need to add the word of flush, which you will learn more about it in the
13

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,340
more fundamental topics.
14

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,270
It's force the output here to come.
15

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,280
So if you don't see the output in the file, you just need to write the flush here in the file.
16

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,900
I'm not sure why.
17

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,270
It's why is it sad, oh, there's a missing come.
18

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,660
Yeah.
19

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,360
That set about creating file an eclipse.
