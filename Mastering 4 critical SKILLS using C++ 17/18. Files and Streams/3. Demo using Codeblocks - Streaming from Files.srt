00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,520
And this video will learn how to read a file from a file using code looks.
1

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,210
First, we need to create a file.
2

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,610
Let's create a file with this name.
3

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,490
So you come here and say file new empty file and then ask you to add to that active project.
4

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,010
Yes.
5

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,360
Give it a name put the name here saving it in our project.
6

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,440
Hello world and save.
7

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,240
Yes.
8

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,300
to the Debug and release yes
9

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,170
Add to both of them.
10

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,480
Now let's put your numbers like 10 20, save the file.
11

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,630
And now let's try to run this file.
12

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,870
You see here in the others.
13

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,960
You see the file here.
14

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,040
And yeah, if you go to browsing the project, you will see now the read file is here.
15

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,180
Let's run this guy.
16

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,640
OK, so we are going to go back to the files here, we see we have now here something called my output
17

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,230
file, but we would like maybe to add it to our project itself.
18

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Like if you came here, you will not see it.
19

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,920
This is your what you see in your project.
20

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,450
This is your actual hard disk.
21

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,960
Now, I can come here and say add active project to both of them.
22

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,950
Yes, yes.
23

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,740
Now, if you come here, you see my output file here see if you would like to remove a file from the
24

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,820
code blocks.
25

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,370
You should differentiate between removing from the eclipse itself and removing from the hard disk.
26

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,050
For example, if I came, I just here and say remove the file from the project.
27

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,940
Now go to what?
28

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,800
What is still on the hard disk.
29

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,150
This is what set on the hard disk the file still on the hard disk it is not removed it only removed from your
30

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,960
workspace if you would like to remove the file from even the hard disk.
31

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You need to come and remove from here.
32

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:58,250
delete, and then, yes, so now they aren't in the hard disk anymore, but they might visible from here see it move
33

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,090
them from here else.
34

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:08,600
Yes, I typically, especially for cp file is good, maybe to remove them from the room from here
35

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,200
and from here.
36

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,940
That's it.
