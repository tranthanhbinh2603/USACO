Let's see how eclipse can help us to create a header file. You can come here, right-click new, and then
1

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,380
you see header file and let's give it a name, for example, calculator

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,430
dot h. In the future, you can learn how to configure the style of the header file, but

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,050
for now, let's go the default and we say finish. You notice here

00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,250
you just come here and say new source file, and give it a name, let's say calculator

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,250
dot cpp,

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,630

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,440
this is very easy.
