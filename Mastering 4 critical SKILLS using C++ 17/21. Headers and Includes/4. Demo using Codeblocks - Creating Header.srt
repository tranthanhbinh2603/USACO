In this video, you will learn how to create header files in cookbooks. So we go file, new,
1

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,900
and select file. It gives you choices,
2

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,590
do you want create a header file or a source file.
3

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,270
So let's start with the header file.
4

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,620
We say go. Next,
5

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,310
It asks you what is the full path. Open,
6

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,220
It would be the project.
7

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:33,990
Let's call it calculator dot h, enter. You see here
8

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,340
this will be the guard name.
9

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,930
It asks you would to add it. add it in both of them and then finish.
10

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,730
You will notice a header file created for you with some initial guard and you will notice it exists
11

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,110
here.
12

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,870
You can also come here and again create some source file for it.
13

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,270
So you see files, go with source, go next, and C++.
14

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,420
Let's give it a name.
15

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:11,730
Let's say calculator dot cpp, save, add for both of them, finish, and then it appeared here.
16

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,210
If you're right click to go to the project itself.
17

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,430
Yeah, open project in the file browser.
18

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,350
This is now what is in the browser itself.
19

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,610
Remember, if you would like to remove them, remove them first from here, it will remove them completely
20

21
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,570
from the hard disk, then, yes remove from the active project.
21

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,490
Sorry, yeah, we need to close them also.
22

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,310
No.
23

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,380
It doesn't exist anymore and come back to the project.
24

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,040
You come here and here and say remove. Now you also removed them from the project.
25

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,640
Remove.
26

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,870
That's it.
