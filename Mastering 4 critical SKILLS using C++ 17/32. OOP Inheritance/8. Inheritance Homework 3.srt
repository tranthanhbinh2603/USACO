1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,600
The third homework set in the inheritance.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,480
Remember, we said that C++ doesn't allow you to initialize inherited member variables in the initial

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,040
results?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,250
Why you think so?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,500
Think in some cases that the language designers considered for that in C++.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,570
Also, friendship isn't inherited.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,770
Why do you think so?

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,800
Comparing the set of objects of a class with its drive to classes?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,660
Which one is bigger?

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,230
Like how many?

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,150
One of them is bigger.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,390
So think, for example, in a working class and Honda, their child, the class which you base, which

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,310
class would have more instances created.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,930
We know that we do not access private variables in.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,910
But are they still inherited?

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,840
Finally, from a different perspective, think about providing protected variables or providing getters

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,520
and setters.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,230
Which one would be a better approach?

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,870
So think like a subclass corruptibility class using the protected data.

20
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,370
Also the coupling.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,280
If we allow the protected data, then they are visible.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,090
To what degree?

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,050
There are more cabling and dependencies between the child and the the class.

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,270
OK, the package delivery service is as following.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,020
You would like to design a set of classes.

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,940
You don't have to write a mean function for a package delivery service as follows.

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,140
We have something we call a standard package which has sender address, receiver address, and it has

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,540
written KG's and some price per kilogram.

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,870
So the total cost, the total cost is eight times the price per kilogram.

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,530
The address is just name city and the name, name and city.

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,430
Yeah, the string and the address of the street and some number, whatever.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,700
Something similar to the package is a standard package with an added fixed fee for the total cost.

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,200
A heavy package is a standard package for heavy weights attached attached with extra weight.

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,970
So for example, if the weight is greater than 100 kilograms, then there is an extra piece of weight

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,080
minus 100 times that, the extra weight in kilograms.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,760
OK, so what we have now here, this extra weight and we use it to add extra fees for the average.

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,490
There are also customers who create several shipments.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,480
Each shipment has a set of packages of different types.

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,100
The total shipment price is the sum of the price of every package.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,830
Each shipment has some information of card used for the payment.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,580
This could be a debit card or credit card and the user might have many of them.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,080
So try to design a set of glasses that express this kind of relationships.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,580
Read this program and tell us what is the output of it.

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,470
And here, read this good and figure out some problems and why this problem happened, how could Syntex

45
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,650
using a Syntex to solve the problem?

46
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,740
I would like you to read this program very carefully investigated.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
There's something interesting here in the mean.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,660
Figure it out.

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,240
Also, what is expected out of this program, thinking about the data members X and Y and Z, think

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
about the visibility of each object.

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,220
Here we have more than object.

52
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,150
So think about the visibility of the member.

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,180
What's visible and what isn't in a similar way, the function here.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,130
What which variable are visible or not?

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,210
That's it.
