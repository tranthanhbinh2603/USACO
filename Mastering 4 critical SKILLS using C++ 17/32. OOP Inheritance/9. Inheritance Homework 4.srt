1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,190
Homework set number four for the inheritance, the string, a class, as you know, is very powerful.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,410
It has many constructors, operators and more functionalities.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,660
We would like to introduce a new class that has all features of string across, but it has one new extra

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,350
functionality.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,730
We will call it decorate.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,430
If it take a string this year, it just give us this kind of concatenation to this thing so it is easy

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,900
for it.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,150
You define a string, you say is to decorate.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,450
If you try to print it, it is like that and you still can compare it and make use of all the previous

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,390
state functionalities.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,440
So how to do that?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,420
An image editor, your team leader, provided you with this diagram to to implement.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,480
I would like you to read it very well and describe it.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,300
Think about implementing it in any thoughts about implementation will later will implement this system

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,230
in the Bollywood film.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,400
The third question and fourth one are less about inheritance, more implicit, but in a way.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,890
So the homework three is a system design system design is is a key word that very close to the system

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,490
architecture.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,970
And it haven't always on the very big picture of the system, when you have a big system of many components,

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,670
we need some people to think about the very big picture with the interfaces, integration between them,

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
reliability, security, a lot of things.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,810
So and in companies like Google and Facebook, they typically have system design reviews for software

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,490
engineers, specialists in years.

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,480
Well, anyway, so let's say we are modeling the Medal of Honor game and there are millions of online

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,020
players.

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,550
We have some message to communicate to the players and now we have to design choices here.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,980
Choice number one is each application vertically, like each mobile app, like your your personal mobile,

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,230
periodically contacts with the server to see if there are new notifications or not.

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,700
The game then the game has some provide provided some online API.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,970
Anybody is a way to communicate with with some external party.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,490
Here is a Medal of Honor game.

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,810
So each mobile just send and receive request and response from the notification that the other way is

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,700
looking from the other perspective.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,510
So this is how the first case mobile is conducting the game.

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,220
The other way is the reverse.

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:42,480
Now the the the evry application register with the system and whenever the server has a new message,

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,030
it go and iterate over the different mobile or different devices and send the message in for every one

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,410
of them.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,820
So the question for you is, should we go that the mobiles are bringing the game?

40
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,870
If they have messages that say every two minutes or the game iterate or all the mobile applications

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,490
and send them the updates, which one is better when discussing the two options and their implementation

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,760
implementations?

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,380
And you start of in every country, there are different banks where people just put their money and

44
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,000
there is also services where they want to be something using their money, like they say you would like

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,180
to pay your electricity bill, your mobile bill and so on.

46
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:28,290
So now with every new service today, let's say there is a new mobile network.

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,190
Each bank wants to support paying the best to this new service so that the customers be happy that the

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,090
they can use their own bank account to pay their bills for even a new mobile network service.

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,520
Thinking about implementing that, we have to have a team that implements something on the side of the

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,880
bank.

51
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,970
And we have also to go to the service site, which is now the new mobile network, and implement something

52
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,220
there.

53
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,070
So now we have new software at the bank site and new software at the service site.

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,540
We can communicate together as an entrepreneur.

55
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,410
Think about the current situation.

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,060
What what is wrong with it?

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,940
Like, for example, how many software programs are built for any banks and services?

58
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,270
Let's say you would like to introduce a startup proposal that offer an elegant solution to this problem

59
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,220
that you will figure out here how to solve it.

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,470
And these are some reading links about validating your business model and to a degree of sphere of success,

61
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,160
this is just for like for your personal benefit.

62
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,520
That's it.
