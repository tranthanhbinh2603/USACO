00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,260
Homework set number one, I would like you to write some set of classes, no details no functions 
1

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,340
just represent this inheritance hierarchy.
2

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,950
In a similar way, I would also like you to build  a set of classes that build this kind of inheritance hierarchy. 
3

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:27,320
Design review, we have a class for wheels, class engine and class car is inheriting from
4

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,910
both of them.
5

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,580
This code is running well in bus system, everything is OK.
6

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,980
Meanwhile there is something wrong about it when it comes to design.
7

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,980
It's important to notice that your code can be working very well.
8

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,350
Meanwhile, it is a big problem in design and this mean in the near future is going to be problematic.
9

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,640
We have this design for mammals and we have here three members.
10

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,690
One question is, what does this design imply about the mammals?
11

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,620
Another question is, let's say the current system is really correct.
12

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,430
After a year, we had a need to add a new mammal to the system.
13

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,770
So it should inherit from here.
14

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,320
But the problem is it turned out, something was wrong with this design and now adding the new class
15

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,750
doesn't make sense enough.
16

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,430
So think and find.
17

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,010
What is this animal, if we add it to here, is going to fail.
18

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,300
So think about it and then try to Google, in were another to identify what might be a wrong mammal here ?
19

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,540
?
20

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,260
Let's say that we have 4 classes.
21

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,330
Each class has 20 functions.
22

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,410
We would like now to add a new class that has a relationship of "has-a" with the 4 classes.
23

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,460
But it is just to a good extent, not exactly has a relationship. So what is a problem that we will face?
24

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,840
to motivate you
25

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,320
more to answer this question,
26

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,260
Here is a scenario.
27

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,640
Let's say we have a class for a robot that just can drive, clean, and do funny moves.
28

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
Just a house robot.
29

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,810
Let's say we have another class for a real animal and this animal can go toilet or make sound and we have
30

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,930
a real cat and real dog.
31

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,190
Now, everything was going very well until a customer asked us to create a class for a robot dog.
32

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,600
A robot dog is like the robot so it can drive, clean, and do funny things.
33

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,240
But remember, it is an unreal dog so it can make sound, but it doesn't go to the toilet.
34

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,870
So back to the problem here.
35

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,300
What is a problem we will face if a "has-a" relationship, it just goes to some extent?
36

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,150
Finally, we would like to implement here all in one machine for printing, scanning and so on.
37

38
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,390
So let's say we would like to implement this system as it is.
38

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,810
What is a problem here in terms of inheritance and in terms of a better design?
39

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,090
What might be a better idea to make it more semantically valid and solve the problem here that we are
40

41
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,490
going to identify? That's it.
