1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,630
In this project, we will implement a simple version from Expedia, that website, so as you know,

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:13,560
the website is something that allow you to reserva flights, to reserve hotels, to reserve workers,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,620
vacation packages that include a mix of all of that cruises and so on.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,000
So you create an itinerary, itinerary and activity to come, which could be very complicated, for

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,900
example, which you can have several itineraries.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,550
And each itinerary can consist of, say, two flights or four flights to OTES two cars and so on.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,140
You can define very big, very big reservation or very big package.

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,450
OK, for now, for our first minimal viable product, something very simple.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,040
Consider only two things.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,520
Flights.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,680
One way or transit and audience.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,940
But remember that in reality we can have all of this bunch of choices.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,940
So make a design that be very extensible and itinerary item can be the following.

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,490
Let's say its flight or hotel.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,190
It would have its own cost.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,590
And also it has some information, let's say that if you have a flight, it could have a request from

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,680
the selected flight and so on in an audit.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,730
It can be the cost to be the total nice time, the price per night.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,110
I would like to think about that in terms of logic, what might be the different logical items for a

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,750
flight for and for a OTRANTO on?

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,570
The total cost of it is the sum of every internal cost to have flight with one thousand dollars.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,110
Another flight was five hundred dollars and hotel booking with one thousand dollars.

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,620
Then the total is two thousand five hundred dollars for simplicity in this project, do not use the

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,420
project is big enough and also use the mydata when convenient.

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,090
There are two types of of of users here, the admin and customer, but focus only on the customer part

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,090
in the bin.

27
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,840
Here is the here is the interface of the user.

28
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,780
The user would see something that allow him to log in or sign up.

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,210
When you say login was one, you exit the user, you start to say hello, the name and then user view.

30
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,500
Then you are allowed to view your profile, make an itinerary or list all your current ones or logout.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,910
Let's let's make an itinerary.

32
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,540
It allows you here to add a flight or at a hotel or you are done.

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,420
So we can keep adding things like add a fly, then fly the no fly then and until then and until then

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,900
I am done this how you are making itinerary of several items.

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,500
So we are not telling him we would like to add an item here.

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,340
It's telling me

37
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,070
enter number and range one to four.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,830
We say until then it started to say,

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,050
I got confused.

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,530
Sorry, we are here, we are here adding a flight number one.

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,470
It says from then which date.

42
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,840
To which date and then says how many others, how many children, how many infants you are providing

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,710
all of them together.

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,740
And after when I give all of this information, it lists it for me for flights to on Turkish Airlines

45
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,810
and to on on Air Canada lines.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,580
So these are the information on your select one of one one out of four of these three trips.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,980
So I selected this third line.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,700
This data is Adami Data and creating in the project to make it easier for me.

49
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,530
So I selected the third the choice here, which is two hundred dollar trip.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,390
Going back to the Choices menu, I said I would like to add an item.

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,820
So adding an order it say from date

52
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,480
this should be to date, not from date, and then saying the country and the city and adults and children.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,730
So this is the input of my hotel reservation.

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,950
They are listed for me, all of these six choices for Ottens.

55
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,980
Also, this is the mydata and here, let's say interior view, six available units, the price per night

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,550
and the from to this, I made the choice of choice number four, which is this Marriott Hotel.

57
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,440
One, two, three, four.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,710
Yes.

59
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,310
This Marriott Hotel, which costs 320 bed a single night.

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,920
Again, going back to the menu, I said, I'm done so so far, I added one flight and one autumn.

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,040
What I'm going to say which option today is a debit card or credit card I selected here, my debit card.

62
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,490
Then let's say here the money withdrawn successfully, reservation confirmed and itinerary resurvey.

63
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,290
This means that we are actually managed to reserve the flight and the hotel and we also managed to to

64
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,020
be the money for you from your bank accounts.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,360
If I back to the top menu and say here list of my itinerary is going to list, the first one is the

66
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,760
preservation of the airline.

67
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,020
It is a reservation for the hotel.

68
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,420
It is the total cost of my reservation.

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,750
Now, there is a function requirements here about the FBI.

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,330
We discussed this before and we had some homework.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,110
So it's now we're going to use it here, which is that Expedia as a website.

72
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,540
He knew nothing about the flights and the course, the details.

73
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,000
He doesn't have a database of that.

74
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,680
What happens in reality?

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:27,560
Expedia is going to contact the FBI is of the flights and all the hotels to get the information.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,020
So we as developers, we typically visit their sites, check and check out their eyes and see what's

77
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,490
available to call it remotely.

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,100
Expedia, also Web site, would like to allow one payment strategy.

79
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,730
There are many, many payments in the eyes.

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,130
But but typically you have only a single one that's activated in your system.

81
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,580
So we are contacting separately eyes for the flights, but only a single eye for the payments.

82
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,840
At the moment.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,230
Our system will have to support the systems, but just one of them will be active in usage.

84
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,000
Assume for simplicity that we have local ice to cool.

85
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,940
Yeah, just just you don't have to make really remote.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
This is outside of the scope.

87
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,700
Just consider them locally.

88
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,110
Buy something that you are going to call.

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,620
When we investigated the FBI for the Air Canada FBI, we find some here, some customer info class.

90
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,840
We found the flight information like from and to the price and then the you go to get flights to get

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,040
vector of Air Canada flights you provide here it is in the function.

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,200
As you see, I'm sitting here some dummy data.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,540
There is a function that they serve with the flight.

94
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,230
It takes the flight and the customer information retrieval.

95
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,550
So I'm assuming that this is going to just return true for now and also you can cancel it.

96
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,320
So, again, just consistent with the rule for the Turkish flight just now, they have also their own

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,570
API, which was their own naming.

98
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,370
For example, you can hear the function here are static discovered function.

99
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,630
You create an object.

100
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,640
And you said this kind of information, this is the available function.

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,430
It's just returning the flight here for the hotels in the Hilton room.

102
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,630
It has a struct for little room with the details of the room.

103
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,270
That function is static for searching the room.

104
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,680
It takes this information that the static data and return to them for the Marriott.

105
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,310
One would also had that it was static function function.

106
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,290
That takes some parameters, but they aren't necessarily in the same order embedding Marriott rooms

107
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,790
and returning it for us.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,660
As you see multiple flights in the eyes, multiple authors eyes, they share similar things, but they

109
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,940
are using their own definitions.

110
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:53,120
For the payments, when you look to the people, we found that they have bibel credit card information

111
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,390
here and they have here like sit in and make payment, you pay money, you get that money and so on.

112
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:09,600
For the these guys here, they are using JSON information, so not the following.

113
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,130
They have this user info card info.

114
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,910
So far so good.

115
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,280
They have sort of these guys have a normal withdraw function that takes the money for you and return

116
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,430
it.

117
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,290
But the guys from the square, Ippei, which will have to support, also are taking just one query.

118
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,610
So they just don't they just think, where is something like that?

119
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,470
So this guy is taking the information here in his trucks.

120
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,340
But this guy would like a stringer that represented your son and you have to pass that adjustment to

121
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,880
get back the there's just an object information.

122
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,100
So thinking it needed business logic, let's say I created an itinerary of two flights and two cars.

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,150
I ask it to be and then we manage to confirm it the first flight and the first item, but then we fail

124
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,940
to reserve with the next flight.

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,340
In reality, what happens to us following one scenario is that Expedia is going to cancel your first

126
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,280
flight, cancel your first cancel its abatement, and then we cancel the flight and the hotel and cancel

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,170
the payment until you.

128
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,600
So the moral of that, if it's having a problem in the middle of the of an itinerary, we should cancel

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
all of what happened so far.

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,930
I would like you to think of what you're missing in the logic, in the eyes and whatever.

131
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,280
And this project is a huge space of polymorphism and zany choices.

132
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,390
So think twice.

133
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,050
My optimize school is like one thousand five hundred with some dummy data.

134
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,480
You will definitely go beyond that.

135
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,500
This is totally OK.

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,820
That's it.
