00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,790
In this project, we are going to take the old project that we already implemented, the askme1,
1

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,100
and we're going to apply object-oriented programming.
2

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,420
This would require from you two things.
3

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,050
The first thing, refactoring. Refactoring is a keyword in the industry.
4

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,190
We mean to take the old code and start to restructure it in a different way.
5

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,630
For example, make sure that the model is model no printing there.
6

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,830
Make sure that the viewing is about viewing, not about logic, and so on.
7

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,640
The previous code also just focus on struct with encapsulation,
8

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,010
but there are no other OOP concepts that were applied. In this project,
9

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,990
you would have to rewrite to consider that provide private sections, public sections, and classes.
10

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,850
Think about setters and getters.
11

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,510
Make sure that you don't force outsiders to make a lot of gettters.
12

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,900
Make sure your class is doing its own job. Use const as possible in functions and in parameters. Minimize the
13

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,170
dependencies as possible between classes. Don't use the friend function, friend classes,
14

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,050
you don't need them. Separate the view from the model,
15

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,510
as we said. Feel free to optionally split it in different files,
16

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,580
but this isn't needed. After you are done with your own project,
17

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,960
compare it with my project.
18

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,300
Compare my old code with my new code so that you can see the differences. Also as a practice for you,
19

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,790
drew the UML diagram.
20

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,820
That's it.
