0
1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,660
In the next problem, we would like to trace what is the output of these two functions.
1

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,830
This is very close to the triangle example.
2

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,260
I hope you notice the following: tracing the first one is easier than tracing the second one.
3

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,500
So let's see what's happening here. In the first one,
4

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,750
let's give it something like let's use something like 'n' equal one two three four five.
5

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,580
So let's see what's happening here.
6

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,690
We remember what's our goal with the recursion?
7

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,300
If we would like to understand it simply, we would like to know what is the function definition, what
8

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,260
is the goal of the function?
9

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,220
So this is the goal now.
10

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,000
We start by printing n%10 
11

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,450
10.
12

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,040
So what is n%10
13

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,330
here? It is
14

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:49,780
five.
15

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,280
So we print five.
16

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,580
And then we recurs on what? n over 10, which is one, two, three four.
17

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,910
So when you think about it, what happens so far is the function
18

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,100
printed for me the last digit.
19

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,550
And then it recursed on the remaining of the numbers.
20

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,420
By definition, the function will keep doing the same, it would print the last thing and go to recurs
21

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,200
on the remaining.
22

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,750
Then it would print the last, which is three and recurs on the remaining.
23

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,550
What does this function do?
24

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,870
This function is printing the number digit by digit in a reverse order, so we can say that this function
25

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,980
is actually print-
26

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,360
Reverse it.
27

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,250
This is actually what's happening here.
28

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:43,840
I hope you notice how I'll try to....,  I don't have to keep digging with the recursion forever.
29

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,650
You have to..,  like from the first steps you can guess what does this function really
30

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:50,890
do?
31

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,980
Now, the second one is harder because the action is happening in a very late time.
32

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,480
So let's see what's happening here.
33

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,690
Uh, let's view the code.
34

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,580
Here is the second function here, the function now is going to recurs first, then do the printing.
35

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,110
So let's again pretend to trace something like one, two, three, four, five and six.
36

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,420
So the function is doing the following.
37

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,810
First of all, it recuses to do something.
38

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,360
So there is something happening here.
39

40
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,080
But happening on what? it happening only on, again, the first five digits.
40

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,540
What's it doing after returning? it's printing the last number.
41

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,860
OK.
42

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,200
But there is something happening before here.
43

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,640
So the last number that would be printed would be printed after what happened here.
44

45
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,460
So this printing would come in the end because something from here will come first.
45

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,770
And we see that it actually decreasing removing one digit.
46

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,880
OK.
47

48
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,700
Let's make one more step for tracing to make it easier for us here.
48

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,370
When we recurs again with this number,
49

50
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,850
it will again go to do something with one two three four.
50

51
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,260
And then, print for me the last number, which is digit, but I hope at this moment that you can
51

52
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,740
see that this is actually is going to end up with one two three four five.
52

53
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,690
So something like printing the digits of this number.
53

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,190
Uh, probably tracing the second one is a harder.
54

55
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,420
But you have to think in this way, you have to think something is happening after it,
55

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,410
I would make use of its output and build over it.
56

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,980
And so on. I hope overall that isn't annoying for you.
57

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,950
This is very similar to printing triangle like that.
58

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,160
We did it before or printed like that.
59

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,970
It's exactly the same idea.
