00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:08,490
Let's do some practice on the recursive function. In this program we would like to print the following
1

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,440
triangle on the left side. a triangle of five different levels.
2

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,960
You definitely know, how to print such a triangle using looping for five times.
3

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,900
I would like you to think for a while,
4

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,940
How can we print such a triangle using recursion?
5

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,880
Give yourself a trial to stop the video and think, how could you write the code?
6

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,970
Now, let me show you the code for this task.
7

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,230
We have here a function of printing triangle(5).
8

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,040
The first question is, why is this a potentially a recursive function?
9

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,880
This is a recursive function because if you look to the output row by row there's seriously a relationship
10

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:59,570
between them, that the second row is the same printing as the previous row, just missing one printing.
11

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,030
So it's actually very, very relevant.
12

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,620
In other words, thinking about what is the relationship between a triangle of five levels and triangle
13

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,920
of four levels, the triangle of five levels is just one extra level, than the triangle of four levels.
14

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,370
So Triangle of five levels, is five stars plus a triangle of four levels, and triangle of four levels
15

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,250
is four stars plus triangle of three levels, and triangle of three levels is three stars, plus a triangle
16

17
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,220
of tow levels, and triangle of two levels is a two stars plus
17

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,010
a triangle of one level, and triangle of one level is just one star and nothing else,
18

19
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,220
And this is the base-case.
19

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,350
So this encourages us to implement a recursive function for the print_triangle.
20

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,180
Let's see
21

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,040
How can we do that?
22

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,350
First of all,
23

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,890
we are going to make a print_triangle() here and it has integer levels.
24

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:58,900
I'm saying here, "if(levels == 0) return;", which means we cannot draw anything of just zero level. at the
25

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,730
ith level,
26

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,880
for now, let's say the level is 5.
27

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,890
So we are iterating here.
28

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:12,400
Let's trace, print_triangle(5) is now here, it is printing 5 stars and then it is calling print
29

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,980
of levels - 1, which is 4.
30

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,750
So what happened is as following:
31

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,400
we printed the 5 stars and we called a recursive function that is capable of printing a triangle
32

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,150
of 4 stars.
33

34
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,080
When this function call here goes with 4, it's going to check is 0? no, It's going to 
34

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,280
print 4 stars, and then it's going to recurs call to print 3 stars and so on, 3
35

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,770
2, 1, 0, done.
36

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,610
Let's also do tracing to make sure that you really get it.
37

38
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,720
The function is print_triangle
38

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,530
taking five, it's going to print  five stars here and going to call print four stars.
39

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,050
The function print four stars is going to print four stars and then call print_triangle of 3 
40

41
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:06,580
levels, print triangle of three levels, will print three stars and then call the print_triangle of 2
41

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,990
levels, two levels is going to print two stars and calling print_triangle of 1 level, one level is
42

43
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,270
going to print one star and call print_triangle of zero levels, zero level is done,
43

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,960
then just we return and return and return nothing.
44

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,950
That's it.
45

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,700
trace
46

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,120
the code,
47

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,430
Think about it.
48

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,840
A question for you, can you print
49

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,880
using recursion, the triangle reversed ?
50

51
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:38,020
So first row is one star, second row is two star, third row is three stars and so on.
51

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,550
That's it for today.
