00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,720
homework set number 1, the first problem you will read two integers A and B and based on being odd or even, we have
1

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,840
four cases, if both are odd, print the multiplication, if both are even print the division.
2

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,010
Feel free to assume that B will be able equal zero.
3

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,690
And if the first is odd and the second is even print the summation and if  the first is
4

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,230
is even and the second is odd, just print the subtraction of them.
5

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,560
And this is a case, for example, here, five and seven,
6

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,830
Both of them are odd so the multiplication is thirty five,
7

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,930
In the second program, you have to read three integers and sort them, sorting means order them, sort
8

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,650
them from small to large.
9

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,450
This is what we mean by ascending order.
10

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,670
The descending order is decreasing.
11

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,380
The ascending is from small to large.
12

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,990
For example, if the input is two, three, one, we will order them to one, two, three, observe
13

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,070
four given three integers here.
14

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,370
There are only three cases.
15

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,350
If they are of different values, if they are equal values, it will be less than that.
16

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,520
Then in this problem, you will read three integers and you have to find the biggest one of them, which
17

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,760
is less than one hundred, if there is no such a number, print minus one, for example, 22, 90, 115
18

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,960
observed here
19

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,170
one hundred and fifteen is bigger than hundred.
20

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,670
So we will discarded we have here 20 and 90 and both are less than one hundred.
21

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,250
The maximum among them is 90.
22

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,760
In this case, all of the numbers are greater than 100.
23

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,470
So the answer is minus one.
24

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,890
In this case, only 50 is less than 100,
25

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,450
so it's only the answer and so on.
26

27
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,820
In this program, you will read five numbers you will read- sorry,  you will read six numbers.
27

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,640
The first number is X, then you read other five numbers and printed the following.
28

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,990
How many numbers are less than or equal X and how many numbers are greater than X?
29

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,560
Is there some relationship between these two outputs?
30

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,980
For example, we return then we read these five numbers, we have two numbers, less than ten or equals
31

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:25,020
ten, which are the one and five and then 100, 200, 300 are greater than ten. That's all.
