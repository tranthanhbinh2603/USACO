00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,620
Let's solve the first homework here, problem number one, for the arithmetic of the two numbers, we
1

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,680
will read the two numbers and to make our life easier, we will have two variables is_even and is_even for
2

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,340
A and B and then based on the check of that, we can easily decide the output.
3

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,940
For example, if not even and not even for both of them, then this is an odd number.
4

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,070
So multiply both of them, if even and even, then we divide them, if not even
5

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,350
and even, then it means odd and even then the addition, otherwise the subtraction.
6

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,230
So this is one easy way to develop this problem. In the second
7

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,530
In the second
8

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,460
problem, we have to order the three integers.
9

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,430
And I would like to ask you if you have thought about the numbers, No, sorry, this isn't the
10

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,290
case, it is in the third one.
11

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:03,090
Let's see the solution here, to sort of the numbers we were going to make the following.
12

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,060
We have the three numbers A and B and C.
13

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:16,540
And I would like to verify first, if B is less than A or not, if B isn't less than A, then I'm going
14

15
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,220
to make sure that they are swept, so that we are expecting A and B. For seek of example here, assume
15

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,320
we have the numbers three, two, one.
16

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,830
So now A is three.
17

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,410
B is two. I'm 
18

19
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,450
verifying, is B less than A? the answer would be yes.
19

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,910
So let's swap them here.
20

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,150
Now, if we swept them together then now this is two and three.
21

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,510
Now let's go with the second part.
22

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,840
If C is less than B itself.
23

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,400
So we are now comparing the second two numbers here.
24

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,590
If C is less than B, we again need to to make similar logic.
25

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,450
We need to push this together.
26

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,480
For example, we need to swap them.
27

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,310
Let's swap them here. Now,
28

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,590
One and three, so far seems good.
29

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:10,930
But the problem here is that this guy now is ordered relative to this guy and this guy, but might
30

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,970
not be the case between these two ones here.
31

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,400
So, again, double check again if B is less than A or not, if this is the case, we again are going to
32

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,630
swap both of them here. This is mainly how we can swap three numbers in the future, we will learn about
33

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,430
a mechanism that can help us to sort a lot of numbers in an easy way.
