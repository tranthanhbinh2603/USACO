Homework set number two,
1

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,700
In the first problem, you will read 10 integers and you have to find the maximum among all of
2

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,760
them, but I would like you to try to do all of the code using only two integer values.
3

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
If this is hard for you, ignore it and just do it whatever way,
4

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,810
but try to stick to two integer
5

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:26,310
only, in the second program, you will read first an integer N, which will be from two to ten, and then
6

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,100
you have to find the maximum among them.
7

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,620
For example, here, you read,five for five numbers.
8

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,640
Then you read all of them.
9

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,150
The maximum would be four.
10

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,570
Here we have ten numbers and then we read numbers and the maximum is one hundred twenty-nine.
11

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,770
This is like same the last example here.
12

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,710
But just when the N is fixed to ten
13

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,090
That's all.
