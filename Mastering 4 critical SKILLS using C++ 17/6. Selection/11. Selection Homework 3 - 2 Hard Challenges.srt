00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:11,850
The third homework set. we will read a number X, then 6 numbers representing three Interval
1

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,920
an interval is something that has a start and end, both of them inclusive.
2

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:22,500
For example, here in this image, I am showing you three intervals, Interval from one to ten here
3

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,820
starting at one, ending at ten and interval from five to six, starting at five, ending at six and
4

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,430
interval from four to forty,
5

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,980
Starting at four, ending at 40.
6

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,350
You will read the number X which is seven here and we would like how many intervals X is part of.
7

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,140
For example X here is a seven, seven is part of this interval and this interval.
8

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,540
So it's part of two intervals in this case.
9

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,980
Here we are reading number 10, and number 10 exists in these three intervals.
10

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,760
And also the last test case; we have a number 10, which doesn't exist in any interval.
11

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,430
All of the intervals would be given such that the start is less
12

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,350
than or equal the end.
13

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,760
So s1 will be less than or equal to e1, s2 will be less than or equal to e2, and so on.
14

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:16,880
In the second assignment, you will read 2 intervals and you have to print their intersections
15

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,420
if they don't intersect, print -1, for example, for the interval [1,6] and [3,8],
16

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,800
the intersection is the interval [3,6] because the interval [1,6] is the numbers
17

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,240
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the interval [3,8] is the interval 3, 4, 5,
18

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,000
6, 7, 8,
19

20
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,010
So the intersection is 3, 4, 5, 6, which is [3,6]. For these four numbers,
20

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,690
[1, 15] and [20, 30],
21

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,720
These two intervals doesn't intersect,
22

23
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,690
So we print
23

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,850
-1, that's all.
