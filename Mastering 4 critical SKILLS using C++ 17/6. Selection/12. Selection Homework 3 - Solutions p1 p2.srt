00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,310
Let's solve the third homework, actually, the first one is easy.
1

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,420
It was more like an introduction to the second one, for the first one, all what you need is to read the
2

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,850
number X and then start to read the three intervals I kept.
3

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,050
Just start and end here.
4

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,870
And then I read the start and end and increment the count if X is between the start and end.
5

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,600
That's all. you don't need more than that.So interval
6

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,710
Second, the third and counter. in the second one, we need to do the interval intersection and this might
7

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,280
be tricky.
8

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,670
And this is why actually you have this assignment.
9

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,110
So let's see here.
10

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,310
You might try to list a lot of different cases, which would be hard and buggy, but you eventually
11

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,940
can do it.
12

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,690
But there is a consideration here.
13

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,340
If you try to think a little more, you will notice the following.
14

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,900
Where does the intersection start and end?
15

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,770
The intersection starts at the maximum of the two starts and ends at the minimum of the
16

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,340
two ends.
17

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,970
If you tried that, it should be good enough.
18

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,400
Now, there is one trick here that would save you a lot of your time.
19

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,510
Try first to make sure that the intersect, if it doesn't, just get rid of this intersection very early
20

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,780
How to know
21

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,750
The two intervals don't intersect if one of them is ending before the start of the second,
22

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,980
which need from us
23

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,570
Two cases here to make sure that ...
24

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,590
If I am ending before his start or he is ending before my start, then we definitely don't intersect otherwise
25

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,910
with the simple observation, we can get that intersection in an easy way.
26

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,310
One good lesson from this problem is many problems can be solved in many ways.
27

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,600
Some of the ways might be easier to find, but very hard to code and some approaches might be hard to
28

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,610
find very easy to code.
29

30
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,560
Sometimes the approach is hard to find, hard to code, but is very efficient.
30

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,760
The moral of that is there might be several ways to tackle a problem.
31

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,390
Do not go with the first idea that comes to your mind.
32

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,770
Try to think deeper.
33

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,130
I also used to tell my students an important to track.
34

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,940
I used to tell them think on papers not on PC.
35

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:29,250
I mean by that when you have a problem, don't rush to the computer to code it because I believe the
36

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,640
coding make like a kind of bounding to your mind.
37

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,670
Your mind got trapped and it's boundaries.
38

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,340
It cannot find good solutions. when you have a problem go far from the computer, pick a paper and pencil
39

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,310
and start to sketch a solution, verify the solution.
40

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,340
Ask yourself what if there is another efficient way.
41

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,640
Let's try to see this problem from a different angle.
42

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,100
This how people in the industry come up with different designs for their problems.
43

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,900
The same problem can be solved with different ways, and every approach has some pros and cons.
44

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,560
So do not be that guy who just rush to the computer to write an idea.
45

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,420
Do not be the guy who just thinks the one way to solve the problem, try to figure out more than
46

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,360
an approach, try to figure out the different like qualities in a solution, that's all.
