1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:07,900
In this video, you will know about more advanced ways to use the "if statements" specifically. let's say
1

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,000
I need a program with the following logic.
2

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,450
If the salary is less than one thousand we print: "you are poor". If it is between 1000, but less than twenty thousand,
3

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,980
You have a good salary.
4

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,310
Otherwise, if you are greater than twenty thousand, you are a rich guy.
5

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,550
Now, how to do that in a syntax.
6

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,540
This is one question, but more interestingly here, far from programming, when you are an engineer,
7

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,820
a good engineer, think in good ways to test his good.
8

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,870
So this is introduce the word "test cases".
9

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,490
Test cases are the cases
10

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,170
where we are evaluating our program.
11

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,780
For example, a good software engineer might decide that I would like to test for a salary of zero and
12

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,700
five hundreds, one thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand and maybe this very big number.
13

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,060
OK, so the logic behind this one thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand, they are the boundary of
14

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,070
the conditions here.
15

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,540
So it's good to make sure that you are doing well on the boundary of your condition.
16

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,520
This is a very big number to make sure that your program is working well.
17

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,550
Also, in other cases, you might think, OK, can a user try a negative number? can you enter
18

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,120
my salary is minus hundred, for example.
19

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,770
And so on. Moving to C++, the C++ offers you what we call the "if, else if chain".
20

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,740
What is the "if else chain".
21

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,840
Let's focus about line 8 and 9 here.
22

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,850
Let's say that you enter the salary like three thousand.
23

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,160
So the line 8 and 9 is what we did in the last time.
24

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,760
We say if salary less than thousand: you are poor, this condition now isn't satisfied.
25

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,790
So we don't get inside line 9. now in C++, we can do more conditions.
26

27
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,220
But in this case we use the word "else if".
27

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,180
So now we say "else if" and then we give a new condition, 
28

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,820
What was the interest in our second condition?
29

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,200
We wanted to know if the salary is between one thousand and twenty thousand, but less than it.
30

31
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,130
So this is our new condition, which is true in our case.
31

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,700
No, it isn't
32

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,870
true still. So in our case, this also false.
33

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,830
Then we said else.
34

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:20,860
So the else here is you are going to get inside it regardless of you were true or not regardless of anything
35

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,310
anymore.
36

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,440
So again, the logic is as following,
37

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,690
You start with first condition.
38

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,020
If it is true, you get inside it.
39

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,650
Everything else is discarded.
40

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,040
If it is false, you go to the next else if condition.
41

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,340
If it is true, you get inside it and discard everything else.
42

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,880
Otherwise, you go to the next else if condition and the next else if condition and the next else if condition and
43

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,360
so on.
44

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,640
As long as the condition is false, we are moving to the next condition.
45

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,240
We might end up with an else only without else if.
46

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,890
If this is the case, you just get inside it.
47

48
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:01,750
So here, if you thought about the logic, we say: are you less than a thousand, there is one handling here. are you
48

49
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,090
between one thousand and twenty thousand,
49

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,120
This is one handling here. else, we are here.
50

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,290
Notice, it is in a bit implicit here, but we know that this (else) happens only when you are actually
51

52
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,590
greater than twenty thousand.
52

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,460
So this how we handled that when greater than twenty thousand by ourselves.
53

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,430
You can still write here else if salary greater than or equal
54

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,240
Twenty thousand.
55

56
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,070
But we actually we don't need this condition.
56

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,810
Let's make a simple practice, let's say that you are reading an integer and you would like to print
57

58
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,970
if it has one digit, two-digit, three-digit, four-digit or more or five digits and more.
58

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,700
For example, if you entered five hundred fifty-six, you would like to say that this is three digits.
59

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,570
I would like to use what we learned to think in some code for doing it.
60

61
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,520
Here is the code, The logic would be very simple, we would say as following, if number is less than 10,
61

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,980
Print: 1 digit. 100, print: 2 digits. 1000, print: three digits.
62

63
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,900
10000, print: 4 digits.
63

64
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,730
Else we know it is definitely ten thousand or more; so it's 5 digits or more.
64

65
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,910
Let's move to a little bit more complex, although it's very logical, we said before that inside the
65

66
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,030
Braces, we can add whatever body we want.
66

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,650
So an interesting question here.
67

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,330
Can I put another if condition here?
68

69
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,160
Yes.
69

70
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,820
Can I put more if conditions?
70

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,180
Yes.
71

72
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,240
This is what we call nested if condition.
72

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,540
We can put more and more and more nested conditions.
73

74
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,930
So let's see the logic of this
74

75
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,630
code. we say read a salary, if salary less than one thousand, we go to this big logic between line
75

76
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,430
11 and line 18, else, we do something.
76

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,190
So if someone entered, for example, 2000, it would just print "you are rich", otherwise it would be
77

78
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,520
here,
78

79
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,280
In the body of this logic. if the person is less than 1000, we ask him for his age and read it.
79

80
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,450
And then we tell him here, if age is less then twenty-two, you are still young.
80

81
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,120
What if the person is greater than twenty-two or equal?
81

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,560
Nothing is printed.
82

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,620
OK, so again here a line to 21.
83

84
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,290
Can we use the variable age?
84

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
The answer is no.
85

86
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,970
This is a local variable and not visible outside its scope.
86

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,560
So in summary, we saw three styles for if condition.
87

88
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,470
You either write a very simple if condition and body.
88

89
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,750
This body can be a single line of code or just two braces with whatever code that you would like.
89

90
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,950
And this can even be like more nested if conditions.
90

91
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,570
The second side is if else chain.
91

92
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,360
So you say if condition, else if condition, else if condition, else if condition, else if condition.
92

93
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:58,560
The third the case is you say if, else if, else if, else if, but you end it with a single else without the if.
93

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,750
To keep going in the chain if condition,
94

95
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,570
If it's true, you go to the body and you stop all of that.
95

96
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,050
If it is false, you go to the next condition and you execute it,
96

97
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,100
If it's true. if the condition is false, you just go to the next condition.
97

98
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,290
If this is false, you go to the next condition.
98

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
If it is true, you get inside it.
99

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,350
If it is false, you go to the next condition, which is just else without if.
100

101
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,900
So we always execute this body. here,
101

102
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,890
We just execute,
102

103
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,850
If we have an else if here,
103

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,730
If we satisfy this condition. The word "condition" refers to the relational operators of true or false.
104

105
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,840
That's it.
