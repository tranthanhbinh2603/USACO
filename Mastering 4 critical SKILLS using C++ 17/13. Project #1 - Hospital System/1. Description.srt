1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,090
So this is our first project in the course, as I promised, there will be many projects in the course
1

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,560
I think on average they are like 2 mini projects and 2 medium to large scale projects and 2 large
2

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,080
projects.
3

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,600
So this is our first smallest system, a hospital system.
4

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:30,300
In this system, Assume that there are 20 different specializations like children,
5

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,680
surgery, and things like that.
6

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,670
For each specialization, there are only five available spots.
7

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,900
So you can think of patients like they are making a queue of maximum five spots, per a specialization
8

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,010
in the system, we can add a patient;
9

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,000
So we need some specialization.
10

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,580
From one to 20, we get a status.
11

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,290
Is it regular or urgent?
12

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,540
If five patients exist, 
13

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,510
we apologize and we cannot accept this patient.
14

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,610
If the user is regular, we add him at the end of the queue like what happens in a hospital.
15

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,260
But if he is urgent, we add him to the beginning of the queue, the very top beginning so we can print
16

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,730
patients for the specializations that have waiting patients.
17

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,040
We..., some doctor might come and pick a patient.
18

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,730
Then we check what is the specialization of the doctor if no patients at the moment we inform the doctor.
19

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,010
Otherwise, we ask the patient to go to the doctor and then remove this patient from the
20

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,250
queue.
21

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,510
We typicaly give him the top one in the queue now.
22

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,510
So let's see some some simulation for that.
23

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,270
Here is what we call a user interface.
24

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,790
an interface is something that the user is seeing.
25

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,990
When you hold your mobile, you are watching a user interface.
26

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,230
When you're accessing a website, you are seeing an interface.
27

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,580
So this is what we call a console interface, just text.
28

29
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,220
So the user here has a menu of four choices.
29

30
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,130
So he chose number 1, which is adding a new patient for each patient,
30

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,970
we add the specialization, the name, the status for the 'i'.
31

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,490
So this is like 15 mostafa 0.
32

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,590
This is 0 for regular, 1 for urgent.
33

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,870
15 is a specialization number and so on. We added another user.
34

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,070
And we added a third user. Notice, the first two were regular, but that one is urgent.
35

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,730
Now we are asked for 2, which is printing all the patients.
36

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,960
So we printed the following: Belal, Mostafa, Asmaa, but notice Belal here,
37

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,940
this guy came here in the top.
38

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,690
We again added another child, another person who is again urgent when we printed "Ziad" came at the top.
39

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,180
Remember that we if someone is urgent, we definitely add him in the top of everyone else.
40

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,030
Let's continue, we are adding one more person at specialization 15, and then we added one more person, but we now
41

42
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,550
have 5 persons in the specialization 15.
42

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,660
So it says: "sorry, we can't add more patients for this specialization".
43

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:15,550
Now, if we try to print, we have these five, three urgent and three, two urgent and three regular
44

45
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,940
Let's enter 3, which is getting a patient so we ask which specialization?
45

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,480
We say 10, but there are no patients at the moment.
46

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,340
OK, what about Specialization 15?
47

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,870
We asked "Ziad", which is the top person to go with the doctor.
48

49
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,150
If we print it again, we get the list.
49

50
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,980
Without "Ziad", let's add one more person.
50

51
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,680
But now for the specialization 7, and then let's print if we printed we see here, this is specialization 
51

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,310
7 and "Soha", and this special 15 and the people here.
52

53
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,590
Let's add another person to specialization 15, let's get a patient from 7, so 7 goes
53

54
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,030
If we printed again, it go back to just specialization 15.
54

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,770
That's it.
