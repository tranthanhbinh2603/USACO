1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,810
Let's talk about some examples that help us differentiate between what is an early value and what is

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,160
our value, or specifically then you are value type.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:19,520
This is it, your salary is one hundred, we say that salary is a value and hundred is our value or

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,390
B, our value.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,770
The as we said, the logic B in all the C things would like salary is on the left side.

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,790
It has an identity.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,760
A hundred is on the right side is it is a temporary.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,910
So salary is the value and hundred is our value.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,650
What I would like you here to keep in mind, as we said in the last time, salary has identifiable address.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,920
We can access its address using and the salary, the embassy and the salary and we can change it unless

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,850
it was consistent.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,270
Every variable name is elder value.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,600
Remember this rule because we will need it more than once in the next sessions.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,880
Every variable name is elder value.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,740
Hundred here is a literal.

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,200
Every literal is a temporary variable.

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,110
Every literal is a temporary variable.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,370
Temporary value.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,200
It has no name.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,750
It has no identifiable address.

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,530
Notice that hundred exists somewhere in the registers in the the in the interim it definitely exists

22
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,040
somewhere, but it has no identifiable address.

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,950
This means with no where is this address.

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,480
It's going to be destroyed soon.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,930
Also hundred is in assignable I can say here.

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,660
Two hundred equals salary.

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:43,580
If you try to do this, this line, you will get an error that say that any value required as left over

28
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,390
of assignment.

29
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,200
What does this mean?

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,770
It's interesting to know about what does it mean here?

31
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,910
This is the.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,940
Assignment, the other end of assignment, and this is the left of the Oberon's now, this lefties is

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,930
complaining that this isn't an value.

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,120
Why is it complaining?

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,810
Because it needs something that has identifiable address to talk this century and put the value on it.

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,800
But 200 has no identifiable address.

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,180
So you cannot copy salary to 200.

38
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,150
You cannot do that.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,470
This why this?

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,920
This error message is about the complaining about everybody.

41
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:27,830
Let's take another example here are defining variable names, A, B, C, and also the underlying ABCDE

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,400
languorously values.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,400
They are names.

44
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:38,530
Names are values, the values of three to two times E plus B, the square root to revive here the CBB.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,560
These are all be our values or our values.

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,310
They are all temporary.

47
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,630
If we did something like into a reference, if one equals B, we call this is a low value difference

48
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,300
in value difference, we could be honest or not honest.

49
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,570
So this is an unconscious reference so we can write something like one equal to any.

50
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,620
This is OK, because if one is addressable and also we can change because it is in.

51
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,860
Now, if you try to do something like reffed plus one equals four, this will give you a comparison

52
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,510
error rate plus one.

53
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,230
Here is a temporary exhibition at Imbrie Value.

54
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:26,260
You can go and address something with this expression greatest the integer ref reference to equal B..

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,470
This is Actionist, a value reference.

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,400
So it's really value because it has a name, it is identifiable address.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,810
But here you cannot change the value of this reference because it is of course it is.

58
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,410
One or more interestingly, operators, most of the operators expect to be our values as their operands.

59
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,540
For example, Iblis be the plus here is expecting some other value and our value.

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,920
For example, it could be two plus three or here two times speak.

61
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,250
So plus is expecting in general our values or our values

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,600
what happens here.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:12,100
There will be an implicit operation that will convert the E from a value to our value and convert B

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,420
from a value to our value.

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,610
This isn't that important for you to know about it at this stage.

66
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,410
But I would like you to know that operators in general expect to be our values.

67
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,940
It is one exception.

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,620
The assignment operator, the assignment operator like Refaat equal to any exhibit and the value on

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,480
itself, the site.

70
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,270
So it should be something like L value equal some expression.

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,910
More zombies, if you say the victor of integer, often this is actually a temporary value, a temporary

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,400
vector of 10 values, but it doesn't have a name.

73
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
So it's temporary and it would begin soon from the memory.

74
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,790
This is a temporary and this is a PR value.

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,440
You say double here and initialize it to zero.

76
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,160
This is also a temporary value.

77
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,070
We do not have any evidence for that.

78
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,150
I would like to provide you with a simple rule that help you always to identify, typically identify

79
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,500
what is in a value and what is it.

80
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,930
Ask yourself, do we have a name?

81
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,560
If you have a name, then it's a value like the salary, for example.

82
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,400
But if it has a name, it means it's identifiable and it has an address which you create an identity

83
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,750
for it.

84
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,800
But if it doesn't have a name, it means it's our value.

85
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,850
It means it could be something tamburri in the memory.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,200
It is an identifiable address.

87
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,350
OK, most of the talk here, I say are value.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,310
We are value fit.

89
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,440
Like I'm using both of them in the same way.

90
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,180
Actually, all what we say as our value is and our value.

91
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,950
But as you know from the diagram of the last decision, there is also another type under the other value,

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,940
which is extra value.

93
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,310
It has a very narrow cases.

94
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,300
So we will come to that later.

95
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,530
That's it.
