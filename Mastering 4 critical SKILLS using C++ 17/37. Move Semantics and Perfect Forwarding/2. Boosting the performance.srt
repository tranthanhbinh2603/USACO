1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,680
In this situation, we will introduce the move semantics and the perfect for wording, they are part

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,150
of the modern C++.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,810
This would section is mainly for one purpose, which is boosting the performance of your system.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,600
Specifically, there are behind the scene a lot of constructor calls or copy constructor calls.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,900
That takes time and we can avoid and escape some of them.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,120
So the purpose of this section is in adding new features to the project itself rather than making the

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,640
project a bit faster.

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,000
If you skip this whole section, you will notice that you can write the same code, you can add new

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,800
functionalities.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,430
However, if you wrote it, you will learn how to avoid some of the extra copies.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,380
So this is the purpose of the of this section is building the processing in terms of dependencies of

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,370
the next sections.

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,910
There are some minor usages for the esteemable.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,930
So if it having that you found that this this section is overall like a very overwhelming for you,

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,510
you cannot really learn it.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,520
You might say what you will learn and keep going.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,560
And maybe when you see this is to remove you just skip it or just do some Googling about it.

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,430
Overall, I would like to warn you that this is one of the hard and advanced topics in the language.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,310
There are a lot of concepts, five specifically, and they are overloaded concepts that they have a

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,580
lot of like angles to understand.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,360
You are expected to find it difficult.

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,670
I did my best to simplify it.

23
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,070
So some guys just oversimplify things.

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,140
But this end up that you don't really know how things are really working or you don't know how to really

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,610
optimize and use them when you are expected to iterate on the material.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,880
And also you find me contrary to many other sections and providing a lot of reading links.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,740
Do not follow the links after the section, after the lecture.

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,690
Just follow them.

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,780
Like when you finish the whole section, come back to them and try to follow them.

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,220
Some of them will be covered.

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,850
And what I was saying mean all of them will be covering some extra information, hopefully free to skip

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,430
as you like.

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,670
Just what I would like you to do, expect it to be a bit hard and typically you'd need some iterative

34
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,050
learning either of my material or maybe or other material that.
