00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,950
One of the topics in C++ is about what we call extreme manipulators and manipulator is something that

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,370
changes the format of the many of the stream itself.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,880
For example, remember we used in Fluting when we something would fixate on scientific and point.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,540
Remember, the rule mainly was to change the output format itself.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,430
So we use scientific you start to see some some scientific notation.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,360
This is what we mean by changing the format of the parameters here.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,610
For example, if you also use a key word like our case, there is more will be printed.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,570
Also one, we want to mention the word alpha.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,710
When you citable the Alpha, the value of the word is printed as true and the value of Foulds is printed

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,290
as a zero.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,040
So this is also when a change to the Elbit itself.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,640
So today we are going to know about little other manipulators.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,500
One of them is called the Schubas.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Schabas is just forcing the same.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,870
Well, if you printed the hundred, it's typically printed without a plus sign.

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,610
But what if you would like a sign for it?

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,070
When you use a city, your position is going to show the sign here.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,500
If you'd like to cancel it, you can say, is that a no show position?

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,540
So now it is going to print without it.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,170
They said CW is one of the most important ones to know about them when you try to bring something like

21
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,260
that one, two, three, four, with two brackets here, it just printed as we expected.

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,970
What if you would like to bring it in a field of any characters?

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,260
But if you do, we mean think of it like any different slots.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:43,420
For example, here, if I say said W5, it is going to set a window of five spaces and then when you

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,250
write one, two, three, four is going by default to write them to the end of the five slots here.

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,270
If you have set of six out of six, the characters are here and then you put the four characters here,

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,710
seven and so on.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,320
What if you would like the printing to be on the left side, so I know say said, but I come here first

29
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,660
and said it is Flagg's to left now when you try to print, it is going to print them in the left side.

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,330
This interview is very important in when you have a printing, say, for tables or so, I would like

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,770
the other to be very organized.

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,570
So S.W. is your way to do that.

33
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,380
There is something called business.

34
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,780
We know about the the DISMEMBERS and we talked about the Minorities' before.

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,000
There are other types of abuses like what we call Octagon and hexagon.

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,710
You do know about the hexadecimal.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,210
You do know about these types at the moment.

38
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,120
But just I wanted you to know that we can bring to the numbers in different ways in Boynton's, because

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,680
you will notice that the numbers are always printed in this hexadecimal format.

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,900
If you read the text of the deal, it's going to bring to the the the number.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,770
This way, if you use the other case, it would be printed this way.

42
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,890
If you don't understand that, this is totally OK.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,110
OK, there is one interesting thing here.

44
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,090
Sometimes when you on your program and there is a crash for it, let's say you divide it by zero.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,090
And there was a lot of how would you expect to see in the console.

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,200
But you look to the console, you don't see the output.

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,630
This is one one of the bothering, puzzling things for a for a newcomer for gaming.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,910
What is the issue?

49
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,400
The issue is in the sea out object.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,660
When you write your data, the actually not printed directly to the console, which is internally buffer,

51
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,910
they think of the buffer like an internal array of characters with every time you bring to something,

52
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,160
the combinat is just in the runtime.

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,670
They put this out in the array of characters printed.

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,070
And this array has a limited size, let's say a hundred character or eighty characters.

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,780
Every time you reach the end, the limit of the array, let's say you print it.

56
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,220
So far, 80 characters is going to print it, print it wants.

57
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,210
What is the point.

58
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,260
So it is writing to a console or writing to a file is very slow operation.

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,140
So the behind the scenes they would like to minimize the number of writings.

60
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,890
That's why they keep putting in the content in an array and the printed it.

61
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,090
It's all of it felt the problem was behind the scenes crashes.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,840
The crash happens, but the real content is imprinted so far.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,360
That's why it could happen that there is a crash and there is an output buffer that is imprinted.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
So you didn't see what you already wrote.

65
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,290
Now, here's an interesting fact.

66
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,690
What if I would like to force the printing to heaven directly without being put in the buffer?

67
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,220
You would the would the flash.

68
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:38,300
So the model of all of what I was saying, if you would force an elbow to really come outside of the

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,690
once you did writing, you just put the word flash.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,760
Once you put the word flush it go.

71
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,550
And the force of taking the output of the buffer so far and just print it.

72
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,600
So if it happened that you have a crash and you don't see all of the L would try to put a flash to force

73
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,920
you feel free to here more.

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,380
There's also another thing that I would like to know about through the whole course.

75
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,070
We were using the out for printing, which is actually two other things.

76
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,730
One of them, the named Serhan said, is abbreviation to console error.

77
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,740
When there is some kind of errors that you feel in there, could you might use the third A.D.s in eclipse.

78
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,440
You will notice the third is printed in a red color.

79
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,620
So the interest in here, if you send a message said, does it have an internal buffer?

80
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,770
So it's always the flush.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,140
It's always printed.

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,620
You do need to put a flush with the Wesser.

83
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,420
So try to use see our concert to see maybe cut difference.

84
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,480
What is it, what is the like the consequence of flushing a lot.

85
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,390
As I said, writing is an expensive operation.

86
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,350
So if you are trying a lot of writing, this is very slow.

87
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,130
You would notice that if you are writing a huge amount of it, that's it.
