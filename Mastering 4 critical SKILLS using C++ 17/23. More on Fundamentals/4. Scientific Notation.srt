0
1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,580
Let's talk about some of the details for the double numbers or the floating point numbers in general.
1

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,110
The first thing we would like to talk about is the scientific notation.
2

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,600
The scientific notation is just a shorthand for writing very lengthy numbers.
3

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,110
For example, let's introduce that. If we have something like 1.2 times 10 to the power 4
4

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,270
we know that this is like 10.000; 10 to the power 4  is just 4 zeros.
5

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,290
And then we multiply it with one point two, we get this big number.
6

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,300
The 1.2 we call it a significant and 4, we call it the exponent of the 10 here.
7

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,330
What about 5* 10^-3?
8

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,390
This is as same as 5 divided by 1000, which is just 0.005.
9

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,140
What about this number times 10^24?
10

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,210
It is very huge number.
11

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Thinking about the left style and right stylem,
12

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,540
we notice that this left style is easily readable, compared to this one, and also is easily to be compared to the
13

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,310
other numbers.
14

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,380
OK, here is one more thing.
15

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,190
If we have this number that times 10^4, it is the same as if this number become
16

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,520
5
17

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,250
but we divide here by 10, or become 6 and we divide it by another 10, or 7 and we divide by another
18

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,770
10, or 8 and we divide it by another 10.
19

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,940
So here is the notation.
20

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,550
The notation of 1.2e4 means that this is 1.2 times the 10^4
21

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,550
OK, which can be represented as 1.2e004
22

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,800
So 'e' here which is referring to the exponential or exponent, it means 1.2e,
23

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,750
when you see 'e', you're replace it with 10to the power and put this number is, 004, is like
24

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,230
4.
25

26
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,240
That's OK. For this number here, 5*10^-3,
26

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,850
We can write it like 5e-3.
27

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,160
So it means 5 times 10 to the power -3. For this number here,
28

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,170
It's written as 1.2387e8.
29

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,760
For this very big number,
30

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,050
we can write it like5.97 blah blah blah e24.
31

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,170
So the scientific notation is writing this number in this style.
32

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,710
You have the significant and you have some power to 10.
33

34
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,240
Then you write it this way.
34

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,130
It would be easy to read and easy to compare.
35

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,370
How to build this scientific notation?
36

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,840
This is an important thing.
37

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,750
Generally speaking, you have to restructure it to be one non-zero digit then 'e'.
38

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,270
So there is always the scientific notation, that is only a single digit here, non-zero one,
39

40
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,870
then you have something here.
40

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,320
This is the details of how to compute that.
41

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,300
Feel free to read it.
42

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,950
It's very logical to think about it.
43

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,000
You would like to give the first digit here so you keep moving the sign like you say,
44

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
7 would like the 7 to be here in the beginning.
45

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,910
So you need to keep dividing here to get it here and so on.
46

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,990
So in terms of scientific notation, you see that this number can be written here. I'm just providing
47

48
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,210
more examples. If we would like this 7 to jump here to the beginning, then we divide it 3
48

49
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,570
times.
49

50
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,270
That's OK. If we have 600 here, and then we would like one digit on here to be 6. ,
50

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,580
so we need to multiply with these 2 zeros.
51

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,060
So you see, if I'm moving left, I'm dividing.
52

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,510
If I'm moving right, I'm multiplying.
53

54
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,840
And notice also here something like 6.7,
54

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,810
We can write it like 6.70000e+00 .
55

56
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,600
What does this mean?
56

57
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,080
It means as following: we have here
57

58
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,720
the 0.7000,
58

59
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,130
This is as same as 0.7.
59

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,850
So don't get confused about that.
60

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,500
And 'e00' just means 10 to the power zero, which is just 1.
61

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,940
So make sure that when you read such a number, you don't get confused.
62

63
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,730
This is what we call it, trailing zeros.
63

64
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,260
Here are two values.
64

65
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,470
OK, here is your turn. Try to think about this one.
65

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,760
Give yourself like one minute how to make it with one digit only here in the beginning.
66

67
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,050
Something like 3.4,
67

68
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,290
probably this is wrong.
68

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,710
So for the 123, it would be one point.
69

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,990
So we need to multiply with 2 to make this shift.
70

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,630
This number, if we put here a point, then there are 5 digits that you need to multiply
71

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,170
with them.
72

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,560
If you have something like that 0.8, then you need to divide by e-10 to get this
73

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,340
number and so on.
74

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,060
There's something here relevant, but I don't want to get in details.
75

76
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,440
It's just confusing what we call the significant digits.
76

77
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,590
So thinking about this number before the 'e', we have up to 6 significant digits.
77

78
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,260
But it isn't that straightforward.
78

79
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,540
Like for example, here in this case, it's just a 3  significant digits
79

80
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:11,760
although we have 6 before the 'e'. Feel free to go to this link to read about the significant
80

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,070
digits, but I just wanted to give you a sense of when people refer to significant digits, they refer
81

82
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,870
to some digits here before the 'e'.
82

83
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,390
It is more tricky when you have some trailing zeros.
83

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,780
But for example, here in this case, we have like 9 digits.
84

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,590
If you have something that involving the 8 here, like all of these zeros would be ignored, then
85

86
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,600
we have only 8 here
86

87
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,760
so it would be one significant digit.
87

88
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,860
It isn't a big deal.
88

89
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,170
I don't need you to understand it at the moment, but just in case, then feel free to go here.
89

90
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,140
But when we say significant digits, we are referring to something before the 'e'.
90

91
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,080
This is what I care about it at the moment.
91

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,190
In terms of code: if you try to print this number, it would be pretty normally, but if you try to
92

93
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,190
print this big number, it would be printed in this notation.
93

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,610
That's why it's important to understand the scientific notation. In C++, you can even force printing
94

95
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,800
of scientific information as following.
95

96
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:15,830
This is what we call, a setf  function so we can say setf(ios::scientific).
96

97
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,640
setf(ios::scientific)
97

98
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,820
Another way is to say that I would cout scientific this way and now if you try to print these two
98

99
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,650
numbers, both of them would be printed in the scientific notation or these two numbers would be printed
99

100
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,780
in the scientific notation.
100

101
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,820
There is also in C++, what we call precision.
101

102
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,430
The precision is forcing how many digits you will need after the point.
102

103
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,880
So if you say here precision ten, if you try to count here, one, two, three, four, five,
103

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,440
six, seven, eight, I guess this would be this would be 10 or so.
104

105
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,490
So now mixing the precision with the scientific notation, this isn't very useful, actually.
105

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,990
What's more useful is just use it with the with the normal representation.
106

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,320
So let's here go back and set setf.
107

108
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,990
ios::fixed, ios:: floatfield. It might look weird for you.
108

109
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,950
Just use it as it is.
109

110
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,400
You are now getting it back as a normal printing; the standard not the scientific notation.
110

111
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,580
Remember, the precision was set here to 10, so if you try to print to this number here, it is going
111

112
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,230
to print 10 digits after the dot and here it is going to print also 10 numbers after the dot.
112

113
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,940
Notice that in C++, if you try to print 100.0, it would just print 100.
113

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
But if you say here 'showpoint', it will force typically point putting the point here.
114

115
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:48,760
So why line 27? It is just forcing the point here and printing. What we're using here is something
115

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,150
called
116

117
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,020
ios three manipulators which will have a separate video for them. The moral of them is you are
117

118
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,760
affecting the stream
118

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,130
output here to behave in a way different than the default style.
119

120
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,140
So the default style is to print this number without scientific notation.
120

121
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,960
When you tell him, hey, I want you to put this flag, it is going to printed in a scientific notation.
121

122
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,300
If you said here, hey, I want you to this precision, it is going to print all of these numbers. If you
122

123
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,200
say, hey, when I want you always to show point, it is going to always print the show point and so on.
123

124
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,770
So this is called istream manipulators.
124

125
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,320
We will talk more about them later.
125

126
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,990
That's it.
