1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:08,240
In this project, we will create a project very similar to "askfm" website and if you know the askfm website, it's
1

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,710
a question where people can ask questions and then you can read the answers.
2

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,070
You can ask more questions and questions and so on.
3

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,090
We target this project to be files based system.
4

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,760
And this means that there are files that maintain who are the users and the questions and the answers
5

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,290
and so on.
6

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,150
You are also expected.
7

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,890
But if this is hard for you, don't try this at the moment, we would like the system to be able to run
8

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,530
in parallel.
9

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,360
What does this mean?
10

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,610
You can login with different users who are asking and seeing the responses on the fly.
11

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,830
So if I ask a question and I see the answer, then the other user if refresh, then he can see the answer in the
12

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,430
same time.
13

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,240
As with any basic system, the system should have full functionality to log in sign up, and sign out in the
14

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,280
system we care with these basic features.
15

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,090
For now, there is also a flexibility about the questions.
16

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,150
The questions can allow to be anonymous.
17

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,280
What does this mean when I'm configuring my system, my settings, I say, do I allow
18

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,710
people to ask me in an anonymous way or not?
19

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,220
If it's allowed to be anonymous, then I don't know who is asking.
20

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,290
But if it is, then the username of the target user must appear.
21

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,500
The user can do operations like printing the questions either from him.
22

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,990
A question for you, questions from you question to you or the overall feed question.
23

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,830
In a system the user can ask and answer these questions.
24

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,820
And there are threads in this question side that we'll see after a little.
25

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,090
You can also delete a question which can be a normal question or a thread.
26

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,250
I'm trying to give you some thoughts about how I was designing this system.
27

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,790
First of all, the systems generate IDs for every user, for example, and for every question.
28

29
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,400
And as I said before, in reality, we always have IDs attached to objects.
29

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,090
This is how we save things in the databases.
30

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,650
A third question is, is something like in Facebook and there are the questions.
31

32
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,770
You ask a question, did someone make an answer?
32

33
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,580
Then someone asks another question, then another question, and another answer.
33

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,190
and so on you notice in Facebook there are threads.
34

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,710
Someone is posting something, you reply another person reply when the reply and the reply and so on.
35

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,220
here in this system, the threads are like one level.
36

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,300
What does this mean is just a single question and bunch of answers on the same level over the same question
37

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,120
correctness.
38

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,280
You should make sure that your system is correct.
39

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,330
For example, the user cannot remove a question, asked it to someone else.
40

41
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,220
You can only see.
41

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,640
Edit your own questions.
42

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,460
and so on.
43

44
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,860
So anyway, let's visualize the screen to get a sense of the system.
44

45
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,430
The menu initially asked the user to log in or sign up.
45

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,570
I'm here.
46

47
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,890
I have hard-coded some names in the codebase to help me.
47

48
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,160
So I said login with Mostafa and three ones.
48

49
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,840
When you get login you see all of these eight operations one and two are printing question to me or from
49

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,110
me.
50

51
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,110
Three is answering a question four is deleting it.
51

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,880
Five is asking a question.
52

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Six would be to list all system users.
53

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,790
Seven to list the feed of all the questions and eight to logout.
54

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,070
I'm here having choice from one to eight.
55

56
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,430
If I try to enter an invalid number, it say this is invalid.
56

57
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,360
Let's try again.
57

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,010
Let's go more with the system.
58

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,510
If I entered one, which is printing a question to me, I'm also having here in my database initially
59

60
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,930
some files.
60

61
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,330
These questions are actually loaded from a file.
61

62
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,510
So there is a file in my system that have information.
62

63
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,210
So here is the questions to me.
63

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,440
I have a question.
64

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,060
ID one or one.
65

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,260
I have another question.
66

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,670
ID three or one.
67

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,400
If you notice under this question, there are also here a thread question, thread question, thread
68

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,820
question.
69

70
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,000
So there are three questions under this question.
70

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,040
This question is coming from user ID one one notice here.
71

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,840
I know they use it in practice.
72

73
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,490
We usually see a name, but I'm just like for simplicity making it from user ID.
73

74
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,750
So we have this question ID from this user ID, the question was should I learn C++ first or Java.
74

75
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:20,830
And the answer to this question was as following there were more questions here, like user ID eleven
75

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,330
also asking why do you think so?
76

77
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,940
And here there was an answer from me and there was another question from forty-five user saying, what
77

78
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,720
about Python?
78

79
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,880
But notice there's no answer at the moment.
79

80
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,710
So this question isn't answered so far.
80

81
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,930
And here it is one more question.
81

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,510
Is it okay to learn Java for oop?
82

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,900
there is here
83

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,580
An answer from me.
84

85
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,000
Notice that this question here doesn't have a user, so it means that this user was allowed to send
85

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,170
in an anonymous way.
86

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,990
And here is another totally different question.
87

88
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,930
So I have two parent questions.
88

89
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,460
And this question is thread.
89

90
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,940
It has thread, two, three, four.
90

91
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,480
There are four thread questions under this question.
91

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,340
On the other side, if I enter two, I see the questions that I made them by myself, for example,
92

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,240
I ask the user ID 11, it was nice to chat with you.
93

94
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,810
And he also replied and say for my pleasure, Dr. Mostafa.
94

95
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,760
There is also another question from me, and it is the user ID.
95

96
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,060
Forty-five, I say, please search archive before asking.
96

97
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,480
But this guy didn't answer so far.
97

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,240
OK, you see here something say not AQ.
98

99
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,560
not AQ, it is just an abbreviation for not an anonymous question.
99

100
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,440
This means that my user id appeared to the user so I can know if my user ID appeared or not.
100

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,550
Now let's move to answering or deleting a question.
101

102
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,930
If I here entered three, which is a question to answer, then I entered a question ID.
102

103
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,860
one or one (101).
103

104
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,950
If you remember 101 is here, this question that was should I learn C++ first or Java? notice that
104

105
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,880
i already had an answer before that?
105

106
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,730
So the system here is sending me warning.
106

107
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,920
Already answered answer would be updated.
107

108
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,770
So if I say C++ is a really good choice as a new answer, this is now would be overwritten.
108

109
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,880
Answer if I say four, four is a question ID to remove.
109

110
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,390
Delete then I entered  the question id three hundred looking here to three hundred then we remove this
110

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,670
thread.
111

112
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,380
That question.
112

113
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,080
If we try to remove the question, one or one (101), it should remove it and all of the thread questions here.
113

114
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,250
OK, let's print one.
114

115
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,560
As you see the question.
115

116
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,130
Three hundred now is removed.
116

117
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,930
Option six give you a list of user IDs and names.
117

118
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,100
You use it to mainly make asking other questions.
118

119
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,450
So here, asking a question, let's ask a question that isn't a thread.
119

120
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,960
So here I'm asking the question say is who to ask?
120

121
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,050
Give me user ID.
121

122
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,920
I say 11.
122

123
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,310
It said note.
123

124
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:55,950
Anonymous question.
124

125
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,180
aren't allowed for this user.
125

126
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:07,060
The configuration of user ID 11 doesn't allow you to ask a question that is without clarifying the user
126

127
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,280
sent from there is a question here, do you need a thread question or not.
127

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,230
if it is a thread, you should give the parent question ID otherwise you should give minus
128

129
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,470
one.
129

130
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,050
So I gave it here minus one.
130

131
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,030
This means that it would be a new question.
131

132
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,490
So I asked here the question, Noha how old are you? going back to the feed seven.
132

133
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,210
Seven is going to list all the questions that have answered so far.
133

134
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,170
So there is a question ID 101 from this user to this user.
134

135
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,430
And this is a question and this is the answer, another question from.
135

136
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,780
But it is a thread question.
136

137
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,640
Question ID 101 question, ID 202.
137

138
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,780
So 101 here is the parent question.
138

139
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,390
ID two or zero (203) is the current question.
139

140
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,400
ID from this user to this user.
140

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,860
And this is a question, this is the answer.
141

142
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,150
And here is one more question to this user ID, notice here the from is invisible.
142

143
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,150
So this was an anonymous question that the feed is just listing questions that have answered so far
143

144
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,960
in the whole system.
144

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,690
If you would like to ask a question in a thread style, so you say five and then who which user
145

146
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,360
and then you give here two one one (211), which is a parent question.
146

147
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,840
OK, so this was my question for her.
147

148
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,610
This this is an ID of a thread, that question.
148

149
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,230
OK, let's login by another user, like let's log out and login now we enter one for Noha to
149

150
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,220
see the questions to this girl you see here.
150

151
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,920
She has this question.
151

152
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,410

159
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:10,260

159

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,430
this is answered.
160

161
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,100
These two are not answered also in these three questions here.
161

162
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,980
One, two, four.

167
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,000
You can use one keyword for the name without spaces.

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,060

That's it for now.
169

170
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,050
I'm going to make in the next video a demo mainly for the parallel sessions.
170

171
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,540

172
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,260
That's it.
