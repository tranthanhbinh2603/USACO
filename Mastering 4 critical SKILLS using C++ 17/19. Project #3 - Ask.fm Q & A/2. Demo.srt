00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,380
In this video, I would like to give a very short demo of a specific feature in the ASKme project, specifically
1

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,220
opening parallel sessions.
2

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,090
Let me tell you what I mean by that.
3

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,250
Let's say here I am going to run my personal code, is asking me to log in.
4

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,810
I'm going to log in with Mostafa and password one one one, now it's giving me a list of choices.
5

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,960
If I give one, it's going to list to my choice by my questions.
6

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,100
Questions to me.
7

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,920
Remember, this is look like a thread question.
8

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,390
These all are questions and rate.
9

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,060
This question, for example, is an answer.
10

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,050
This is another question.
11

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,950
And so now we can run the same project several times.
12

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:50,430
For example, I can here run again and say I'm going to run with say Noha 222 it's going again
13

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,090
giving me a list.
14

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,440
Let me print the question that came from Noha itself like two here.
15

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,640
OK, so Noha is asking a lot of questions like yeah, a lot of them depends probably on the
16

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,030
first guy here, in Eclipse, you can switch between the two views easily and code blocks are going
17

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,000
to generate like one black screen for every one of them.
18

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,980
Now, by being parallel, I mean something like a real situation.
19

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,060
If you are on a website like ask me and you are asking a question, the other guy can see the question
20

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,780
in Facebook.
21

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,940
If someone commenting the other guy is seeing the comment, this means there is somewhere the programs
22

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,900
are like handling this kind of information together in a way or another specifically here, you will
23

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,740
depend on files.
24

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,610
You need some files.
25

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,590
You need to keep these files very updated with the new things such that the other code can all the
26

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,840
time refresh and load the updated status, note.
27

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,180
If this is hard for you, just skip it in the beginning and just go ahead and implement like
28

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,520
a one system per one user this is totally OK.
29

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,350
I would like to show you here something.
30

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,150
This is a user Mostafa so Mostafa
31

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,060
would like to, let's say, answer a question.
32

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,870
So here we get the three.
33

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:14,160
Now, let's answer this question, which has ID three zero two.
34

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,100
OK, so the question is, why so late?
35

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:26,790
OK, let's say very sorry for that now if we try to print to the questions again of my side, we should
36

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,390
find it here updated.
37

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,800
This is the easy part.
38

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,950
But I would like to make sure that the other guy here.
39

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,190
Noha can see the update, so Noha at the moment has no answer for this question if now she clicked
40

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,460
two again is going to find the answer here.
41

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,770
notice that both of them are working on files and both of them are being updated in the same
42

43
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:47,990
time.
43

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,420
So let's go back here.
44

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,340
Let's say that I would like to delete a question.
45

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,700
So let's delete question number four and I'm going to delete one or one, which is the third question
46

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,750
with a lot of questions.
47

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,770
So I'm going to give the ID here of one or one here.
48

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,470
Now, let's separate the questions.
49

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
I have. notes here
50

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,820
Most of them are done.
51

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,990
This is the easy part.
52

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:16,150
Now, let's go to the other user here and let's print their questions from me to notice that all of them
53

54
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,670
are removed.
54

55
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,080
Why?
55

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,220
Because all of them were the thread questions, for word two Mostafa.
56

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,890
So the moral of that is we have two sessions that now communicate to the Single-file, reading it
57

58
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,620
and writing it together.
58

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,710
It could be one file two files three files, it is up to you, please
59

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,130
When you are trying to solve a big problem, try to make it simpler for yourself.
60

61
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,070
First, if the project is big, try to think in a very simple set up and very simple features and start with
61

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,250
them.
62

63
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,900
Don't make it very hard for you.
63

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,490
That's it.
