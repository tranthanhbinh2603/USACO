1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,810
Let me take you in a very short tour in the queue.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,270
They were led diving in the could itself up to you.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,570
Please read the could criticize it.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,340
I might not be the optimal one.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,290
I probably write the code very fast.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,410
The Good has a built in admin user, which has user name Mustafa and Best with the three ones and customer

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,540
name as Matt was 2-2-2 as a password.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,670
So you can use this ones to try my good.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,510
There are here some nice functions to be helpful.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,150
There's a function that will return for us the payment date.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,060
Now, when we start to look to the big picture of the code, we noticed we have book and book reading

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,330
session user and user manager's books, the manager.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,820
We have a user view, we have an admin view and a line reader system so that the functionality of the

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,250
system looks like small functionalities.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,150
We ended up with something like 700 lines of code or so.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,070
So let's see what's happening here.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,420
The book, as you expect, which I expect you to guess, it mainly has some information as we see while

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,790
the admin is inserting them, and we have here the badges.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,270
Then we have a function that allow us to read the book and bunch of sitters and and getters here.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,150
OK.

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,530
In the second one, we have what we call the book reading session.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,770
It's very important to separate the book and book reading session.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,840
Don't mix things with each other.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,710
As we mentioned, there is what we call the cabling.

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,540
The concept don't cover things in an unnecessary way.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,540
Now we have here a book reading session, which admittedly has a book and has a current debate and has

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,100
lost access date.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,890
And this is a way to represent the current image and some bunch of information the user can request

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,960
to move next page.

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,360
Or we move to the next page or to the bereaved speech.

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,590
And every time we can reset the lost access, we update this.

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,120
This is doing here.

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,220
So this is merely another utility complementary to the book information.

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,760
The user is also a class that I expect to to have it with the user name, password and all of the all

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,660
of the information.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,570
Here is a flag if this is an admin or not in a different scenario.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,010
You can actually, like, have something more complex, like inheritance or so.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,690
This is a representation of the user.

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,290
This is reading for the user and just a bunch of some some information.

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,320
This is something that returning to the reading session of the user.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,310
So the user here has what we call its reading decisions.

42
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,140
So the reading session is list of all of the books that he is orbiting at the moment in another design.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,740
Maybe you're going to have this list here.

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,390
May in another thing that's OK.

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:54,740
The third one is the users manager, which would be managing mentally what is who are in the system

46
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,570
as admins or as customer users.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,610
It doesn't make sense that this class be loaded multiple times.

48
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,900
It should be once in the system.

49
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:11,480
So this kind of lines of code here will be will cancel the ability to copy or delete a copy this copy

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,070
or assign this class here.

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,360
The database here has a condition I like just for simplicity.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,790
Um, I'm just assuming if we looked at the database once, then don't load it again.

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,950
If you have multiple sessions, you don't.

54
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,670
You shouldn't do that.

55
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,140
You actually need to make sure that you are loading things in every step.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,440
This are the two, the music that I have in the system and I have here a map that mapped from the string

57
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,950
like user name to the actual user in the system.

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,490
Here is the accent of the system, it says that you do not need to log and you need to sign up, and

59
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,010
then we have the menu here for the and the menu here for sale.

60
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,280
Sign up the sign up.

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,080
Make sure the first that this username doesn't exist so that we guarantee some uniqueness in the system.

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,620
It allow us to add some reading session here.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
Getting current user, which I'm quoting here, current user.

64
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,500
So as as we are a single person who is running the system, just a single user, he is all what we need.

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,370
And the next step, we have the books manager, which should again have some mapping from the book idea

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,940
to the book when I'm shooting here, some also some of the dummy data in the class.

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,380
The next things are about viewing, we have a user view and we have an admin view, so let's separate

68
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,730
them these two things.

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,990
It is the user view.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,660
It would have the user menu with the different choices.

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,340
We we just give the choice and we just apply it here and so on.

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,940
And in a very similar way, we have also the admin view, which again will have it's it's the stuff

73
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,180
you need to like, follow up the design and see what I'm using and strategic to will be different for

74
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,690
the me.

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,510
You can even be better than me.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,480
This is totally OK.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,450
Uh, yeah, this is merely the overall of the system.

78
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,770
This is a major menu here.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,540
Uh, to just, uh yeah, like to to proceed with the system.

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
And this is around the system.

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,560
So this is a very high level overview.

82
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,350
I will like diving in the system itself up to for you and feel free to raise up questions in the queue.

83
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,870
Thank you.
