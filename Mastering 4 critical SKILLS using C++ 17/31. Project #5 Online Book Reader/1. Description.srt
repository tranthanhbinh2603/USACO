1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,270
In the next project, we will implement an online book reader over all this is a simple project.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,030
So from functionality perspective, it's limited.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,620
Specifically, let me tell you first the big picture we have something in software engineering that

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,210
we call functional requirements and we have what we call non-functional requirements.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,750
The functional requirements is actually what we initially as a as a Z, students focus on it, which

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,790
are the functionalities provided by the system.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,870
In reality, there are a lot of concerns that are actually non-functional.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,740
For example, the usability to what degree the system is understandable, usable compatible with something

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,040
like customer experience, for example, to a degree, the system is secure, reliable to a degree,

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,530
the system is fast to what degree we can like maintain the functionalities and scale the system from

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,230
like 10000 users to one million users.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,410
Nothing here like a function that these are expecting.

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,030
They are non-functional requirements.

14
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,750
Please take time to learn more about the non-functional requirements.

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,090
You should meet this again in the software engineering, of course, but pretty good to have some background.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,490
So now going back to our focus, the focus is functional requirements in this project.

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,360
The user has mainly two users who could log in or sign up the admin user and the customer user.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,550
In fact, in this system, the admin user doesn't sign up is just logging.

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,130
The customer is one that can log in and sign up now.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,590
Mainly the main role for the admin is to just add books here in the system.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,750
The user himself can read one book at a time, and we will have history.

22
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,180
If his session sections of books, as we will see during the session, the user can browse the books

23
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,260
and navigate between them.

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,110
For simplicity, you don't use files in this one.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,580
You don't use any better decisions.

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,430
You focused mainly on the design of the system.

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,750
So let's see.

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,510
There are more constraints for simplicity.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,570
The admin users are already added to the memory, which is like your database here, so there is no

30
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,570
sign up actually for the admin, you don't need to sign up for the admins.

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,870
The second thing is that you can also add in the system initial books a bit, which will make it easier

32
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,910
for you to just test the system.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,620
But the admin can add books.

34
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,360
And the second thing is, you can also add initially some customers, but the user can sign up in the

35
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,150
system, so this is to be the user can sign up and the inputs make everything symbolic.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,750
For example, to use all of the strings without spaces, assume the user is behaving verbally.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,770
Don't waste a lot of coding in these directions.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,510
So let's see some usage here.

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:48,660
The system is start by menu that has log in and sign up, and I'm having some users in the system,

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,700
but in a way I selected to sign up.

41
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,720
So I'm adding user name Billard one to three, my user, my name and email.

42
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,220
Now we started the system, we see the use that has four items.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,540
The first one is his profile and the last one is the logo.

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,740
So what is the first one?

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,750
The profile, if you connected to provide it, just will list your current information.

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
This is fair enough.

47
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,390
Number three and number two are important here.

48
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,340
Number three can list for us the current, the books that are available in the library.

49
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,100
So we have here three books, as you see now.

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,270
The user can select one of these books, let's say selected C++ book later.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,060
The user can request the number two, which will show his reading history.

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,310
So we know that here the C++ C++ book has five widgets.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,890
The first we are in the current image, which is the first page, and it has content to plus plus plus.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,180
This is just dummy content.

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,660
No, the user can navigate in the screen.

56
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,550
He can go to the next page or go to their previous speech or even stop reading.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,630
So let's see.

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,270
The user here decided to navigate to the next.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,640
So now he is in two over five.

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,710
This is dummy content.

61
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,010
Again, next.

62
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,270
So now he is in three over five C++.

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,530
He then click the next, you know, in four five and this is dummy text.

64
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,610
Now we decided to go two, which is previous, which this is now three over five.

65
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,340
Now these are decided to stop reading here.

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,510
Remember, we were in a C++ book and with the last image was three page number three.

67
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,390
Now the user see again the choices here.

68
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,730
If the user selected two, he will notice that he has one entry here which a C++ how to program Beja

69
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,610
three were five.

70
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,450
And this is the last time and that you were in this session.

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,940
So now which session to Auburn, you have your only one a choice, so you selected it Auburn again,

72
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,130
that you are in big three over five with C and C++.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,340
So this is what I call by session here.

74
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,900
And I mean here by session, a reading decision for the user what he can navigate.

75
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,260
For simplicity, these are can have multiple sessions of the same book.

76
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,330
Don't get confused by this request.

77
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,620
I'm just meaning that if you go back here, let's say these user decided to go back to this.

78
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,950
This he can see C++ again.

79
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,290
Then he can select C++ again, which will be added.

80
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,300
Don't try to make extra logic.

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,120
If you are confused about this is that means just ignore it.

82
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:23,480
Now one thing here this program would be random chance, but during the running, everything is maintained

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,050
in the memory.

84
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,850
For example, if the user logged the out, then look the end.

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,530
He can still see this session again in the system.

86
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,890
Now let's move to the admin the admin logged in.

87
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,850
My code has like hardcoded user Mustafa and 1-1-1.

88
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,900
So this is the admin that Mindy can add a book, which is number two.

89
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,270
Then we started to add the information of the book.

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,460
The book has four pages and I started to add the content of the pages done right in hospice's here.

91
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,480
Keep things to be simple, design wise.

92
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,580
This has limited features, but meanwhile, if you tried to make a good design, it's going to be like

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,200
a bunch of lines of codes here.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Not not sure to program.

95
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,330
Try to make things as simple as possible and focus on the design itself.

96
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,580
There is no there are no better decisions.

97
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,010
Just run the program only one one run to improve your design skills.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,490
Please draw your best to design early before any coding.

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:24,350
Then could the system then re update your design and ask yourself this mandatory and fundamental question

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Why did I miss this voice?

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,590
You will notice that there is always a gap between our initial design and our final design.

102
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,580
Why?

103
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,730
Because some some areas in the coding would be shadow.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,700
A lot of uncertainties.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,970
So when you are done with the coding, everything would be clear.

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,960
What matters here is you try to compare and think, how can I the next time spot this kind of missing

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,290
things?

108
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,860
Finally, try to read my work, compare and learn about it.

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,090
Look what if you are done with the project and you would like to go more and more?

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,240
I suggest for you, you might stop at this point.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,450
I would like you to keep going in the in the in the in the in the in the course.

112
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,920
Maybe you can come back later.

113
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,630
But anyway, here are some thoughts.

114
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,180
Sometimes in some systems, the admin must activate the sign up for the user first.

115
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,230
So you see you signed up in the system, but you are allowed to just just use it.

116
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,060
The admin must activate it first.

117
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,290
How can we implement that?

118
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,400
What if the admin would like to edit, delete and search the books?

119
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,430
What if the customer would like to clear all of his session?

120
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,350
Probably this is an easy, easy case.

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,010
What if we would like to read from file allow better decisions?

122
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,860
What if we would like to look information in the system?

123
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,340
We can have multiple admins which admin approved, which user like.

124
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,220
We need to know this information, which admin added this book and so on.

125
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,030
I'm not going to implement for you something like that.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm not going to provide implementation.

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm not going to provide support for you in this in this features, but just more for you if you would

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,740
like to keep going.

129
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,700
That's all.
