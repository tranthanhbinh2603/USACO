00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,090
Let's do some practice on functions, remember, we already took the Employee program and we already saw
1

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,610
these functionalities and these screenshots, now we are going to take our old code for the employees
2

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,430
and we are going to make it using functions.
3

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,460
I assume that you already practiced this program and you read my code and you thought about it.
4

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,050
Now, the first thing that we can do is the system itself.
5

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,200
We are going to create a function named "Employee_system", we call it here from the "main".
6

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:36,130
So the "main" function is calling the "Employee_system", which has a while loop and it's calling another function
7

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,710
called "menu", the "menu" will list the menu for the user and it is going to take a choice from him.
8

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,890
And then based on the choice, if choice number one, we call "read_empolyee", choice number 2 "print_employee",
9

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,280
choice number 3
10

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,350
We "delete_by_age", choice number four
11

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,320
We "update_the_salary_by_name".
12

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,910
So if you noticed about the logic here, we are making our life much much easier.
13

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,040
So now let's see what are these functions that we are calling.
14

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,900
first, let's make our life easier,
15

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,850
We are going to define something called
16

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,730
Global variables.
17

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:16,240
This is defined under the "#include<iostream>" and "using namespace std;", the local variable is something
18

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,990
that is inside our function, such as "main" and yours.
19

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,080
The global variable is defined outside the function.
20

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,610
This makes it visible for all the functions that are exist in this cpp file.
21

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,050
That's why we call them global, that everyone is calling them.
22

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,040
We call these ones local because only their function is seeing them.
23

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,590
So I'm defining here my variables as global variables,
24

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
So everyone is just seeing them.
25

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,880
This is a "menu" function, it gives a while-loop it list the choices, it asks for the choice, if the choice invalid, 
26

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,710
it just keeps trying again.
27

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,040
Once the user entered a valid choice, it returns it.
28

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:03,860
the "read_empoyee" is just taking nothing, and we have this global variable "added" and we read it item by item.
29

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,500
the "print_employee" is just iterating all the employees that are global and just printing them. 
30

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,790
"delete_by_age", is reading the start and end and just iterating to delete it.
31

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,340
"update_salary" is again iterating and updating the salary of the user. notice that these already are the code
32

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,630
blocks that we did before,
33

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,310
We just move them to a function to make our life much easier.
34

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,240
That's it.
