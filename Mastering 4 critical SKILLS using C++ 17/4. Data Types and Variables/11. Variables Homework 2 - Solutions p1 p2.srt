00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,190
Let's solve the second homework. The first one is about tracing, if you tried to run the code that I
1

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,680
provided to you, you will observe that the output is one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, 34
2

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,640
, fifty five.
3

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,760
And this is the same output of the Fibonacci sequence.
4

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,480
The Fibonacci sequence is a very popular one.
5

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,590
It has a lot of mathematical properties.
6

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,150
And if you observed, every number is the sum of the last two numbers.
7

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,300
For example, thirteen is a sum of 8 and fiv5, five is a sum of two and three, fifty-five is a sum of
8

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,470
thirty-four and twenty-one.
9

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,420
Twenty-one is the sum of eight and 13.
10

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,190
Fibonacci is very popular and very common and appears in many things.
11

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,700
So what does this code is actually doing, it is actually generating a Fibonacci sequence, if you observed,
12

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,370
I'm trying to say number three is number one plus
13

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,650
Number two, I'm trying to say the current Fibonacci is the sum of the last two numbers.
14

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,360
And I'm repeating the operation for many, many lines because it's very common.
15

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,250
I am moving number two in number one and the value of number three in number two and computing the new
16

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,280
number three, which is number one plus number two.
17

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,200
Anyway, none of that was your business
18

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,160
in this homework, all of what you had to do is just to keep tracing the code.
19

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,200
It is a good skill to be able to observe patterns in things.
20

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,570
Yeah, but anyway that's all about this problem.
21

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,330
In the second problem, we have to do that swapping idea, swapping is all about swapping two values
22

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,280
together from one thing to another.
23

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,400
Let's get the code from here.
24

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,600
I asked you to write three numbers to do the swabbing,
25

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,860
Maybe I can find some picture that would make it easier here.
26

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,290
Swap two numbers, images.
27

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,960
I guess there was something here that I remember it was.
28

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,370
Yeah, that photo is a nice one, let's open it.
29

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:09,980
Look to this image here, let's say you have two variables, A and B, and you would like to swap
30

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,900
their content.
31

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:19,790
So the idea is as following, you introduce a third temporary place and the idea is to move the content
32

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,580
in a in the temporary place.
33

34
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,290
Then you move the content of B to A..
34

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,930
Now you get back the content of the temporary to B, give yourself a minute to watch what's happening
35

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,730
to the two values here, 30 and 50.
36

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,630
So that's all because it will be very hard for you to swab the content without a third value,
37

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,160
although it is doable, but not our business at the moment.
38

39
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,810
So here is the code, we introduce a third value, which is temporary.
39

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,010
And I start to take the value of num2 and move it to num3.
40

41
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,450
Now, both num3 and num2 have the same value, now moving the value of num1
41

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,090
inside the value of number two.
42

43
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,740
Once you're done with that, you can get the temporary value and put it back here in number one.
43

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,210
It's very important to understand these three lines because this is something that is very common in
44

45
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,810
literature.
45

46
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,430
If it's still hard for you, you might also watch this video. That's all.
