00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,820
In this session, we will learn about two core concepts in any programming language, data types and
1

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,390
variables.
2

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,300
A lot of data are uploaded daily on Internet, on social media
3

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:26,050
this could be your personal information, such as age and name, your images and videos and so on.
4

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,090
A lot of data.
5

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,340
But what is the data type of this information?
6

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:42,250
If I'm saying I am 52 years old, "52" here is our value, we call it a number definitely , but but when
7

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,930
it comes to programming language, we start to give other kind of names.
8

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,650
We call it in C++, integer.
9

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,070
So I am 52, 52 is a value.
10

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,020
We call it a number, C++, call it an integer.
11

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:02,200
If I say the baby is 2.7kg, 2.7, we also call it a number, but C++ differentiated
12

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,380
than the normal number and call it "double" or "float"  a double number, is a number that involve a fractional
13

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,030
part, a fractional part.
14

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,390
So it isn't just complete like this one.
15

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,240
I could say also my name starts with Z, "Z" we call it a letter, in C++,
16

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,800
we call it character.
17

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,920
Computer is for us a word, but for C++ we call it a string or a sequence of characters.
18

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,600
These all are similar to what we have in our real life.
19

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,220
There is one more special category in programming.
20

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,100
If I say that, are you male or female?
21

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,910
It seems like nothing special for humans, just the status of two things in C++ and programming languages.
22

23
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,950
We call it "Boolean", Boolean is something that has two different types only.
23

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,130
Let's elaborate more on the Boolean data type
24

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,630
It is something that is just true or false, something that involves only two things.
25

26
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,610
If I said male and female, then male is true, female is false or the opposite.
26

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,630
If I have a coin, it could be only head or tail two states only.
27

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,660
So we can think the head is true, and the tail is false.
28

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,410
Your light can be only on or off.
29

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,910
And we always say that computers only understand on and off, so "on"
30

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,280
here is a "True" and "off" is a false.
31

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,360
In addition to that and actually, this is how things are implemented, "True" is actually 1, "False" is
32

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,990
actually 0.
33

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,500
And in the very low level of a computer, it just understands this kind of zeros and ones.
34

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:44,480
So we learned about integer, double, character, String and Boolean, there are actually more other types
35

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,410
and details. In normal courses, they keep digging in a lot of details, but I would say a better learning
36

37
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,680
style is just to stop on fundamental things here.
37

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,370
And later, we are going to elaborate more and more.
38

39
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,600
The other thing that we would like now to talk about it, is that the need for names, let's say we want to
39

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,970
build a program for a hospital.
40

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,520
We need to refer to patients like, say, "Mostafa is 50 years old and he has two children!".
41

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,070
We have a doctor who has a name, salary and address and so on.
42

43
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,990
Now, we would like to represent this information, from one side
43

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,290
we need to put them in memory when the program starts.
44

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,880
Memory is something that you usually find inside your computer, inside your laptop.
45

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,750
Typically this way, it's where we store the temporary data for us.
46

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,270
So we need to put them in memory.
47

48
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,580
And also we need to give them some names so that we can refer to them.
48

49
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,930
So, for example, what is Mustafa's age?
49

50
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,800
It's 55
50

51
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,820
We need to refer it
51

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's highlight more.
52

53
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,090
What is computer memory?
53

54
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,730
Computer memory is more like streets.
54

55
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,680
If I told you where do you live, you typically have some street name like I'm living in 127
55

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,660
John Street, so it seems like 127 is some location.
56

57
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,110
John is the name of this street and inside your home there are different types of people, some
57

58
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,660
are male, some are female, and we have also children and so on.
58

59
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:18,230
So, we notice here the memory, the memory has locations and has names and this is actually what a memory
59

60
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,520
would look like in reality.
60

61
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,560
Think of it like boxes.
61

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,880
Every box has some information, here in box
62

63
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,680
number 2, (like the street number) we have
63

64
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,340
"Age", this is a name we have a value of 55
64

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,050
we have a data type which is integer.
65

66
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,150
We have a 3rd box in the memory.
66

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,840
Its name is "Weight"
67

68
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,390
its value is 92.5.
68

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,750
Its type is double, and so on.
69

70
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,180
You can think of it like for (Example 6), 6 positions in memory
70

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,500
every position has a name and has a value and has a type, we call it variable.
71

72
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,380
So when I say data type I'm referring to, is it integer?, is it double?, is it character?
72

73
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,350
And when I'm referring to the variable name, I'm referring to Age, Weight, Group and if I'm referring
73

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,030
to the values like 55 and so on.
74

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,000
So over all, (Age=52)
75

76
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,660
We have a name: Age, we have a value: 52.
76

77
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,960
We have a data-type which is integer and it exists somewhere in the memory, somewhere in the RAM.
77

78
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,750
OK, as a side note, we call the variable name, we call it "Identifier" so we typically will use the
78

79
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,920
word "Identifier".
79

80
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,180
As a homework for you, I would like you to guess the syntax rules of C++ for the following valid statements.
80

81
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,000
Read them,
81

82
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,860
think about all the components of them and try to guess what they're meaning
82

83
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,260
till the next lesson.
83

84
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,100
That's it! :)
