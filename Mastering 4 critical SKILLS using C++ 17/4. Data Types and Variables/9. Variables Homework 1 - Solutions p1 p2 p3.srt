00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,820
Let's see how to solve the problems of the homework, the first one, I guess, is very straightforward.
1

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,530
You just need to start to read the values here, I selected integer,
2

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,070
But I guess this isn't the best value that you should choose.
3

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,000
For example, the integer here will make a problem when it comes to that division.
4

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,770
So a more proper way is to use a float number.
5

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:33,630
So this is like a bad choice here, a proper way is to say, like, for example, double a and b, because
6

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,640
this will fit with more reading in the input and also fit with the output itself.
7

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,110
Otherwise, we are just printing all of them.
8

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,750
If you tried with yourself to divide by zero, you will notice that this isn't working very well.
9

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,400
It will actually crash if b is zero, the more we go in the course,
10

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,070
You should understand that and you should learn
11

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,710
how can you handle this division by zero.
12

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,380
In the second problem, also another straightforward, you should read and do the 
13

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,250
the average part.
14

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,450
So let's see this code here. In this one here,
15

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,840
I started to read the first person.
16

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,830
So here is its name.
17

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,890
Here is the ID.
18

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,190
I selected double because this is a good choice for the average.
19

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,260
And then also in a very similar way,
20

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,430
Reading the second guy information here and after that, I follow the screen by printing the grade number
21

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,870
one and two, and after that, I am printing here the average of the two numbers.
22

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,890
I was tricky in the sample input, I used 20 and 30 which will have definitely the output as twenty-five.
23

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,910
But if I use something else like let's say twenty and thirty-one, then the output will fail.
24

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,580
If grade one or two is integers.
25

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,530
And also this isn't a double format like this point is zero.
26

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,330
So be careful about the used data types here.
27

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,630
In the third problem, we would like to get the even and odd sums, so it's all about the positions, this
28

29
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,990
would need, like a few thinking or a few minutes to think about how to do it in a smart way as an
29

30
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,620
advice.
30

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,680
When you have an idea to solve the problem, don't just go directly with it.
31

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,250
There are too many ways to solve the same problem, especially when the problem is a bit hard.
32

33
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,270
So give yourself the time to think about how to solve a specific problem.
33

34
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,870
The easiest way, in my opinion, I defined here four variables for even and four variables for odd.
34

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,220
And then I'm reading them in a direct way, odd one then
35

36
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,350
Even one, odd two, even two, odd three, even three.
36

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,410
This way the even variables are together and odd variables together are ready for me to just use
37

38
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,340
them and print directly.
38

39
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,400
So I hope this is like an elegant way to try the problem. That's all.
