00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's solve homework
1

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:11,160
number three, the first problem is about swapping three numbers that we will read, there are two
2

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,950
ways to do that.
3

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,420
One might think, OK, what if we just swap the number one
4

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,440
with number two, then now number one and number two content is swapped.
5

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,010
Taking number two content and number three content to swap it is done then this should be fair enough.
6

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,420
For example, if we are here, if we swapped the content of A and B, you will observe that the a would have
7

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,690
value 20 and B would have value 115.
8

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,810
If you swapped now the B with 301, the B will have 301 and the c will have the coming from b (115)
9

10
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,080
So, you can use to swaps
10

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,470
to solve the problem.
11

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,820
But if you tried to make use of the problem itself, you can do something much more smarter.
12

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,240
And it's, as I said, similar to the swapping of the two values which is circulating the numbers.
13

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,300
If you observed, it seems num1 is going to number three.
14

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,790
Number two to number one, number three to number two.
15

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,830
So it seems like they are moving in a circle.
16

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,230
So I am introducing here a temp value moving number one to two, then making the circle two in one, three
17

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,770
in two.
18

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,590
Now we are ready to get the temp and put it in number three.
19

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,790
So this is what happened by circulating the number together here.
20

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,510
In the second homework, the print me, which I guess was a bit hard for some of you guys, the
21

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,210
idea is as following, the idea is to convert B to something that creates an equation of zero and one.
22

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,610
Let's see how. I'm going to create this equation here.
23

24
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,430
Eventually, the equation has the value of equation number one, which is a times a, the value of the equation
24

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,390
If the answer is negative one, which is two times a plus one.
25

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,580
So far, so good.
26

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,880
I'm trying to have a value here that would be either one or zero and this one would be either one and
27

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,150
zero.
28

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,600
If is_one is one, then is_negative_one
29

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,380
should be zero.
30

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,210
If is_one is zero, then is_negative_one should be one.
31

32
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,720
So, as you see, with any input, either this one would be printed or this one would be printed.
32

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,940
So this is the moral of the algorithm, you can think of this problem in a simpler way,
33

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,070
If I told you that B is either one or zero, if this was the case, then you just multiply here B and
34

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,130
one minus B, B would be one and one minus B would be zero, if B is zero, one minus B would be one.
35

36
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,090
But I made it a little harder and told you that B is one or minus one.
36

37
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,970
So the first thing I'm doing here is I'm checking if B is one or not, which is simple here for us.
37

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm adding B plus one and dividing by two.
38

39
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,430
So I found this very simple equation.
39

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,290
Let's trace it.
40

41
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,750
If B is one, one plus one is two, two over two is one, that's perfect.
41

42
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,860
On the other side, let's say B is minus one, minus one plus one is zero, zero over two is zero.
42

43
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,700
So is_one so far is very straightforward.
43

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,130
In the other case I would like to get the minus one, so to do that, I just subtracted one from is_minus
44

45
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,340
one.
45

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,090
Now, if is_one is one, is_negative_one would be zero.
46

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,870
If is_one is zero, then is_negative_one would be one.
47

48
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,650
And this way the equation is ready for us to print the two, as I mentioned in the homework,
48

49
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,530
This problem is solved much easier and trivially using the if condition.
49

50
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:44,860
But I'm just showing you if we have fewer tools, how things are a bit more complicated. In the homework
50

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,740
number three, we would like to sum the numbers from one to n.
51

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,620
And if you like mathematics, you should find this problem very interesting for you.
52

53
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,220
The idea is as follows.
53

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,580
Let's say we have numbers from one to eight.
54

55
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,680
What is the value of one and eight, which are the first and the last number? 9
55

56
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,900
What is the value of the second and second to last?
56

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,850
two and seven is also nine.
57

58
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,400
So this is nine and this one is nine too and three
58

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,470
and six is also nine.
59

60
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,540
Three and six is also nine, four and the five is also nine.
60

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,770
And you should find an easy logic why they are always nine, they are always n plus one.
61

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:33,140
It seems we can divide this sequence into (n / 2) pairs and every pair has a value of n plus one
62

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,540
In our case, we have eight values.
63

64
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,180
We divided them to four pairs each
64

65
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,010
pair has a value of n plus one.
65

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,110
So if we used this simple equation, anyplace, n * (n+1) / 2, we should get the answer.
66

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680
Now, the equation so far is good for even.
67

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,990
But what about the odd?
68

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,110
It also good for the odd.
69

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,010
But I would like to think about it by yourself to verify this one is working well.
70

71
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,150
