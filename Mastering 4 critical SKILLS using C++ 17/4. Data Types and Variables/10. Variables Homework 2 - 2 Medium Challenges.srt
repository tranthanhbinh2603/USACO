00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,680
homework set number two, on the first problem, you will be doing a tracing mean to follow
1

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,740
step by step by yourself and guess the output as if you are the compiler, we did that before.
2

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,500
You will take this number one, number two, number three.
3

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,870
And then observe there is like a kind of pattern here.
4

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,820
So anyway, try to guess the output here, which is like mainly couting the number of three here.
5

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,160
And after that, educate yourself about what is fibonacci number.
6

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,040
Here is a link.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,810
And the second program, we will do a swapping operation, swapping is a very common term 
8

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,800
in programming
9

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,740
It means to exchange the value of two things.
10

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,240
For example, let's say you read 2 integers here, num one and num two.
11

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,550
And then let's say the input is seven and 231.
12

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,510
We can do a swap operation which will exchange the content of these two variables,
13

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,500
Number one, number two.
14

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,910
And then we print them.
15

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,650
They are two hundred thirty one and seven.
16

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,650
So they are now swapped or exchanged.
17

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,950
You are right, three lines of code here that will take number one.
18

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,300
And number two, do the Internet exchange so that the output is like that.
19

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:13,740
That' all.
