Homework set number three.
1

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,650
In this program, we will extend the swapping two numbers, to swapping to three numbers, maybe swapping 
2

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,230
here is in the best name for it,
3

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
but anyway, what I mean by that, let's say we have three variables, A, B and c with these values:
4

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,190
One hundred and fifty two, any three hundred and one, then the new values will be 20 you see,
5

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:29,080
like the B content in A and then C and B, so three hundred and one and the A and C one hundred and fifty.
6

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,910
I would like you to read these three numbers and print them to apply the exchange that we mentioned here.
7

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,740
Try to do it in any way.
8

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,090
But if you would like to challenge yourself, you can do it only in four lines of code.
9

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,390
In the second program, we will read two numbers, A & B, integers, I'm sorry, during the course I read
10

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,320
the word the wrong way, but this is how I used to pronounce it.
11

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,740
The proper way is, I guess, integer.
12

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:09,670
But anyway, you get used to me saying it's like integer, you are to read  integers here A and B and B will be either
13

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,750
minus one or one.
14

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,290
If B is minus one, you will print two times A plus one.
15

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,080
If B is one, you'll print A times A.
16

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,900
I would like you to think of these two formulas as just big formulas 
17

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,270
For example, it can be A times A times A times A because I found so many students are
18

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,400
trying to find a way to handle the printing part.
19

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,930
It's all about the B
20

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:37,120
here, you are to find a way to print this content based on the value of B try to think in a simple one
21

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,170
line formula to guess that the output here, in the future we will learn about the (if) conditions and you
22

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,810
will see how this problem would be much, much easier when we learn the (if) conditions later,
23

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,530
And the purpose of this homework is to see how when you have more and more programming tools, you can
24

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,920
do things in much more simpler and elegant way.
25

26
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,270
In the 3th program, you will write a program that read a simple integer and print the sum from one to
26

27
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,630
N, for example, if the input is N equal five, the output would be 15 because the sum from one to
27

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,980
five is 15.
28

29
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,710
here are more examples,
29

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,280
4 is output 10.
30

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,320
5 is 15, 3 is 6.
31

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,280
And so on, you need to find a simple one line formula to solve this problem, again
32

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,740
in the future, we'll learn something named for loops.
33

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,900
It will be easier way to do this problem.
34

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,240
However, with a simple formula, this solution would be much more efficient.
35

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,000
The more we go in the course, you will know that the same problem might be solved in several ways and
36

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,820
there might be differences in the efficiency of the solutions.
37

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,100
To get the hint for this problem, listen to the remaining of the of the picture.
38

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,240
The hint is as following,
39

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,900
Let's say that the input in is equal eight,
40

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,380
write
41

42
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,850
The numbers from one to eight.
42

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,400
Then think about the sum of the first and the last number and then the second and seventh number and
43

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,880
so on.
44

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,020
What do you observe?
45

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,150
Find the formula that is good for even numbers first, like N is even and then think of an odd N. as an
46

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,370
extra thing you might think about what is the maximum
47

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,790
N after it the submission from one to N will be more than the maximum of the integer?
48

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,050
You might think about that too.
49

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,440
That's all.
