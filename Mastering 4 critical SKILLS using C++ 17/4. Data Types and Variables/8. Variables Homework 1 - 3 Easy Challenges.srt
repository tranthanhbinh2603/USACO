00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,510
Homework No. on this basic program, you will read 2 numbers and print there +, -, *
1

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,640
and / operations, for example, if the input from the user is 12 and three, you output
2

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,570
these four entries here with a + - / and *. 
3

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,870
Try to think about, like, how to test your code in a good way, maybe considering zero as a first or
4

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,930
second number, maybe negative values, maybe even old values,
5

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,690
try to think about the max value of int, give some trials
6

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,540
this should raise up some questions that during the course you should get some answers for them.
7

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,910
In the second program, you will write a program that reads 2 students' information about math exam.
8

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,400
You will read per a student is name, ID, and grade, and then you will print them
9

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,490
according to the picture here, for example, we read the student number: name, ID, and grade second
10

11
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:04,680
name I.D. and grade, then you have to print them and also print to the average of the math exam.
11

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,160
So we have 20 and 30,
12

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,880
The average is twenty five.
13

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,770
So please stick to this input and output style, think about your selected data types like an industry,
14

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,660
someone like the teacher or the school will give you the following scenario, but you have to be careful
15

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,620
about your assumptions.
16

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,310
For example, is exam's grade integer?
17

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,580
So you have to think about that.
18

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,130
Even and Odd sum, in this problem, you will read eight space-separated integers.
19

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:46,080
Here are the eight numbers and then you should find the sum of those in even places and the some of
20

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,690
the odd places they even places like the second four, six and eight number, for example here.
21

22
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,260
the second would be 2 then 9, 4, 3, -1, you will sum them,
22

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,920
This is even places and the remaining are the other places,
23

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,110
So you should just print this even sum and odd sum.
24

25
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,700
That's all.
