In this video, we will learn how to create a class using codeblocks.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,530
You come here new, and you select the word class, give it a name, let's say calculator.
2

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,700
You will notice there is a dot_h file that will be created for you, and CPP file which is looking at this header
3

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,810
file. There is also here
4

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,550
a bunch of other options like has a constructor, virtual destructor.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,860
You will learn more about it during the class, you also learn about inheriting if there another the class.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,840
You can create default member variables,
7

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,210
but personally I usually just created the default thing, added it,
8

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,060
OK, so now you notice we have now a class with the constructor and virtual destructor, we have here
9

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,640
the dot_h corresponding for it, and then you start to fill the missing here.
10

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,510
That's it.
