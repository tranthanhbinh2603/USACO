In this program, we will.. In this homework will solve the Tic-Tac-Toe some people, consider it a project,
1

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,400
but this is again a simple assignment,
2

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,710
so don't like don't be cheated by that.
3

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,240
And it will be challenging for you because I would like you to develop it in a smart way.
4

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,220
We would like to develop a tic tac toe, but it will not be three times three,
5

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,590
it will be N times N, for simplicity here,
6

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,620
let's say N maximum is nine, but you can do it in any number,
7

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,050
you will are run a game of two users who will keep playing till one of them win or tie eventually, print
8

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,600
to the grid after each round.
9

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,790
We started with three, for example,
10

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,790
the user write one and one, so we put an X for him,
11

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,090
now it is o turn three and one we print for him here the O here, two and the two we print for him
12

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,460
the X at the two and two.
13

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,470
Now two and one
14

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,250
we print it here, we put it at two and one for the O, the user now entered two and two which is already
15

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,580
there.
16

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,020
So we say invalid
17

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,330
try again, five and five, again, invalid.
18

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,660
Three and three is good position and X just won the game.
19

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,530
You can write this code to be a very ugly one, writing a lot of for loops to verify the rows and verifying
20

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,270
the columns and defining the diagonals,
21

22
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,210
I would like you to try to use the direction array track to implement this code in a very nice and smart
22

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,480
way.
23

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,720
If you found this hard, maybe start with the ugly way,
24

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,070
just write a bunch of loops to verify all of the rows, all of the columns out of the diagonals for
25

26
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,880
the winning cases.
26

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,640
And after that, maybe try to make it better or check out my solution. That's all.
