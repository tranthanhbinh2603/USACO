<p>Just in case some students are confused, here is a written description. The rule is simple: if some sub-expression doesn't affect the final result, it might be discarded.</p><ul><li><p>Assume expression is A and (B or C)</p></li><li><p>Assume A is False</p><ul><li><p>As it is A and exp2, we are sure the final result is False. Discard (B or C) sub-expression</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Assume A is True</p><ul><li><p>Now, the result depends on (B or C)</p></li><li><p>Assume B is True</p><ul><li><p>True or whatever = True. No need to evaluate C. Discard C</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Assume B is False.</p><ul><li><p>Now we have to evalaute C</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So use your logic:&nbsp;is it possible to discard this sub-expression or not?</p><p>In practice, we use short circuit evaluation in our codes, but only with simple and clear expressions.</p><p><br></p>
