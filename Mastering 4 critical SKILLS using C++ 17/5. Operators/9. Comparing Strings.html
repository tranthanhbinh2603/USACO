<p>How does C++ <strong>compare strings</strong>?</p><p>Assume all are lower case. The answer is exactly as your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order#Basic_order_and_example" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>English Dictionary</strong></a></p><p>- Letter by letter is compared<br>- If a word has a <strong>smaller letter</strong>: it appears first<br>-- E.g. love &lt; zebra as l is before z<br>-- E.g. love &gt; long as lo are common, but v &gt; n</p><p><br>- If one word is done in comparison: the <strong>smaller in length</strong> comes first<br>-- E.g. counter &lt; counterattack</p><p>What about a mix of upper and lower cases?<br>- <strong>Upper letters are smaller than small letters</strong><br>- A &lt; a<br>- A &lt; z<br>- Z &lt; a<br>- loVE &lt; love&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(as V &lt;&nbsp;v)<br>- loVe &lt; long&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(as V &lt;&nbsp;n)</p><p><br>Overall: letter by letter comparison and decision based on which letter is smaller</p>
