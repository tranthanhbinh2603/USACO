In this video, we will discuss the operators' homework, there will be several homeworks in this lecture.
1

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,040
to divide it,
2

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,870
The first one is a guessing program output.
3

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,550
So you proceed with the program step by step and act like a compiler.
4

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,740
Most of the tracing here is what we said,
5

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,150
Good
6

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,500
expressions like they either have no side effects, like the A B, nothing weird, or just one operator
7

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,520
that we are increasing.
8

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,810
So it is fair enough tracing without weird things.
9

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,260
The second program is another tracing that mainly tests your understanding to the comma operator
10

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,240
in a "cout" statement.
11

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:58,400
In the third program, you have again, good tracing here for the code, but there
12

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,580
are like two codes that I would like to test your understanding.
13

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,470
But in practice, like, we still avoid coding this way, although it's correct, but it needs more
14

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,420
understanding of what's happening.
15

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,040
But still don't go this way.
16

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,710
I'm just testing your understanding.
17

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,490
That's it.
