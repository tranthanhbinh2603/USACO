00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,860
Let's solve the second homework sets here, so the first problem is about checking if a number is even
1

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,420
or not in three ways.
2

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,890
Using number mod two is the standard way to know if a number is even or not.
3

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,050
By the way, using mod two and comparing with zero is better for both even
4

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,530
and odd, for example, if you'd like to check if a number is odd or not, then check number mod two not equals
5

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:28,720
zero.
6

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,260
Why?
7

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,760
Because if the number is negative in the even case, it would not matter, because in both cases it
8

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,350
would be zero.
9

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,870
But if the number is odd, three mod
10

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,920
two is one, minus three mod two is negative one.
11

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,320
So now it's going to be tricky and you have to be careful.
12

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,020
So the best thing is to compare against zero, equal equal for even and not equal for odd.
13

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,970
Now this is a standard one.
14

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,320
How can we use the division two and modulus 10 to make a check?
15

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,800
Remember that when we divide a number by two, there are one of two cases for the fractional
16

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,570
part it is either point zero for an even number or point five for the odd number.
17

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,810
So the idea here is to get the fractional part, similar to what we did before,
18

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,320
We can get the double number minus the integer vision to get the fractional part,it the fractional
19

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,310
part is zero.
20

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,270
Then this means this must be an even number.
21

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,350
The mod ten is different case and easier one, if you noticed when we take a number with mod ten
22

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,900
if it is even,
23

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,880
then the last digit has to be zero, two four, six or eight.
24

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,790
So we can double check against all of the choices.
25

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,230
If it's any of them, then this is an even number.
26

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,270
Definitely.
27

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,070
We go with this approach in industry.
28

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,530
But it is good to be aware of other approaches.
29

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,650
In the second problem, we would like to get the sum of the last three digits.
30

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,960
OK, so let's see.
31

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:05,600
The idea here is using the modulus ten and division by ten idea, if you divide the number by 10, 10,
32

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,950
10 or by 1000, you actually.
33

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,710
OK, I'm sorry, I switched.
34

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,520
This is the fourth one.
35

36
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,270
Let me get this one.
36

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,240
Sorry.
37

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,080
Can I switch it, sorry for that.
38

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,950
If you would like to get the last three digits then you can take modulus ten, you get the last digit
39

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,500
and then divide by ten, you remove it, modulus ten, get the last digit, division by ten you get it,  modulus ten 
40

41
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,740
you divide by ten to get it.
41

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,950
So for example, if the number is five, eight, six, seven, two, if you did modulus ten, then you get
42

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,490
the five.
43

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,980
If you divided by ten, you remove the five.
44

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,150
Modulus ten, you get the seven division by ten, you remove the seven, modulus ten 
45

46
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,520
you get the six, division by ten, you remove it.
46

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,560
This is how you can get that three digits sum.
