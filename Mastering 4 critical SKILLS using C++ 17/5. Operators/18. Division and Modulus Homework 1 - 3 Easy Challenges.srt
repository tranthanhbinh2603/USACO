00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,560
Homework number one for the division and modulus part, in the first program, you will read five
1

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,790
numbers and print the following, their average, the sum of the first three numbers divided by the
2

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,410
sum of the last two numbers.
3

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,760
So here are the five numbers that we read as an input,
4

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,260
And then their average is 3, because 1, 2, 3 is 6, 10, 15, 15 
5

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,370
Over five is three.
6

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,850
The sum of the first three numbers divided by the sum of last two numbers, that should be one, two,
7

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,270
three, which is six divided by nine.
8

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,220
And finally here in C the average of the first three numbers divided by the average of the last two
9

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,720
numbers.
10

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,130
So the average of the first three numbers are six over two, six over three, which is two.
11

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,040
And the average of the last two number, which is nine number two.
12

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,770
And that is the question here.
13

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,530
Is there any math relationship between B and C? in the second the program would like to print the
14

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,380
fractional part of two numbers when they are divided,
15

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,500
For example, if you divide two hundred and one over twenty-five, the answer is eight point zero four.
16

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,600
I would like you to try to print this zero point zero four.
17

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,840
This is a fractional part that we would like to print.
18

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,020
Our reminder, we know that N%M computes the remainder of the division, I would like you to
19

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,530
write a program that reads 2 positive integers and print their remainders, but you shouldn't use the
20

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,570
model operator, for example.
21

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,510
Twenty seven and the twelve with models
22

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,490
we know they are three.
23

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,220
I would like you to get the three without using the model operator itself.
24

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,900
So remember, what is a math equation that we need to get this three value
25

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,560
That's all.
