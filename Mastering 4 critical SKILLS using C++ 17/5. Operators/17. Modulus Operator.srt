1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,070
In this video we will discuss about the Modulus operator, let's motivate it, let's say that we are
1

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,000
using a 12-hour clock style, let's say we are at 9:00. now,
2

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,340
One question is, what is the hour after like another 12 hours from now ? it's 9:00, it is again going to be
3

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,670

5
9:00.
4

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,020
What about 4?
5

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,070
If it's 9 and after 4 hours, it is going to be 1:00.
6

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,270
So far, so good.
7

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,910
OK, what about if we are at 9 and we want to go 16 hours.
8

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,090
So 16 is just a 4 + 12.
9

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,570
So after 12 hours, it would be again 9 and then after 4 hours it's going to be 1:00.
10

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,040
So after 4 hours or after 16 hours, is the same as 1, after 17 hours, it's going to be 2:00.
11

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,190
OK, what about if we are at 9 hours and we would like to go after 29 hours.
12

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,680
So we know that 29 is like 5 + 2 * 12.
13

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,550
So after 24 hours we are still at 9.
14

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,350
And so what matters really is 5.
15

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,990
So 29 is eventually, what's really critical is 5, so 5 and 9 we end up at
16

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,350
2.
17

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,570
What about before
18

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,490
24 hours?
19

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,640
We are still at 9.
20

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,630
Before 25 hours? we are at 8.
21

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,770
The cool observation here is every multiple of 12 is useless either in after or before.
22

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,610
What really matters is the reminder.
23

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,680
What really matters is here,
24

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,240
what is less than
25

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,590
a multiple of 12.
26

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,500
So mathematically (a) modulus (n) written like "a%n" is finding the remainder after division.
27

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,400
So we know X divided by Y, now
28

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,330
X mod Y, let's say that we have (a) with 27, (n) with 12 then (r) for remineder is (a%n)
29

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,320
For example here 27/12,
30

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,900
We know that 27 is like 2 * 12
31

33
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,260
+ 3 divided by 12.
32

34
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,750
So here 2 is the maximum possible multiples of 12 here.
33

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,820
So 2*12/12 is just 2 and then 3 divided by 12 is 2.5.
34

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,600
We say that integer is the integer division part or the quotient and it is the maximum possible multiple,
35

37
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,150
We cannot put a third one. 0.25 is the fractional part of the division.
36

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,940
It's mainly coming before because of the 3 divided by 12.
37

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,160
So 3 is actually the remainder of the division.
38

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,800
It's coming from subtracting the 27 from the highest multiple here which is 24.
39

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,440
So 27 - 24 is just 3.
40

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,610
So when we write 27 mod 12 it is just the 3, the remainder of the division. this
41

43
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:56,930
mod must be this less than 12 it must be, otherwise it would be one extra integer division part here.
42

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,180
Let's go back to the division of 25/5.
43

45
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:09,010
Thinking about it, we have here 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 0/5.
44

46
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,520
This part is what represents the Mod here.
45

47
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,850
OK, so 1/5 in the division is .2, in the modulus, it is 1, 3/5 in the division
46

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,880
would be 0.6, in the modulus it would be 3.
47

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,500
Again, this modulus has to be less then the 5.
48

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,580
OK, so mainly try to solve an equation in terms of the multiples of 5, the possible multiples of
49

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,250
5, maximum one, then the remaining either use it as a fractional part or as a division part.
50

52
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,590
Here is one more example.
51

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,470
Let's say that we would like to try 27 divided by 7.
52

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,580
So now the maximum multiple of 7 here is 3, (3*7 + 6) / 7,
53

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,950
So we have 3 + 6/7.
54

56
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:04,280
So this is the fractional part or the mod is just here the 6, coming from 27 - 21
55

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
21 for 3 * 7.
56

58
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,580
Now coming to the really very critical observation about the modulus and what really matters for you
57

59
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,990
when it comes to engineering.
58

60
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,160
The modulus 2  and modulus 10, have nice observations.
59

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:26,180
First of all, the modulus 2, when you take an even number modulus 2, it just gives you zero, and if
60

62
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
it is an odd number, it just gives you 1.
61

63
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,100
So using the mod 2 "%2", you can figure out if the given number is even or odd.
62

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,690
This is a nice observation.
63

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,720
The second observation is the mod 10 "%10", let's investigate mod 10 here.
64

66
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,880
For example, 100 % 10 is 0, 1001 % 10 is 1
65

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,250
1008 % 10 
66

68
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,180
is 8.
67

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,140
What is happening here?
68

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,760
the mod 10
69

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,620
gives us the last digit.
70

72
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,190
Remember last time we said that dividing by 10 remove the last digit now mod 10 gets for us the
71

73
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,830
last digit.
72

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,670
Now what about mod 100 ?
73

75
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,300
Gives us the last two digits, last two digits mod 1000? 
74

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,280
Then gives us the last three digits mod 10000?
75

77
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,530
So then gives us the last 4 digits.
76

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,870
So the division and the modulus are playing very, very nice part in integers.
77

79
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,110
The division is removing the last K digits and the modulus is getting for us
78

80
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,970
The last K digits, this way.
79

81
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,260
We can split an number to two different parts.
80

82
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:37,440
Yeah, that's it, so mod 2 can tell us if number is even or odd, mod 10 can give us the last digit, divided
81

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,370
by 10 can remove for us the last digit.
82

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,040
That's it.
