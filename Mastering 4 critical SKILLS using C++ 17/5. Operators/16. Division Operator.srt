0
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,840
In this video we will dig more behind the division operator.
1

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,510
Let's first remember the multiples.
2

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,240
If I told you the multiples of 4, to be 4 * 1, 4 * 2, 4 * 3 and so on.
3

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:22,050
So the multiples would be like 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on, the same for 5, the multiples of 5 are
4

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,680
5, 10, 15, 20 and so on.
5

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,950
What is the biggest multiple of 5.
6

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,970
Less than 30.
7

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,290
25.
8

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,650
OK, so let's try to investigate some about the division, specifically the integer part and the
9

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,070
fraction part.
10

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,880
If you say 6/2, this is normally 3.
11

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,990
12/2.
12

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,030
We can divide that to 6 + 6 divided by 2, we can distribute it.
13

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,000
So it's now 3 + 3 with the 6, 20 divided by 2 is like 12 + 8, divided
14

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,960
by 2,
15

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,310
Distribute 6 + 4 = 10.
16

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,330
Now what about 21.
17

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,970
21 is like (20 + 1) / 2.
18

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,160
So it is like 20/2 with10,
19

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,170
1/2 which is half.
20

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,470
So 10.5.
21

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,010
10 is the integer part, 5 is the fractional part.
22

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,980
Let's investigate what happens here.
23

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,860
25/5 is just 5.
24

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,590
26/5 is like 25/5 plus 1/5.
25

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,420
So it's 5.2.
26

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,080
Here, 27, it will be 2/5 which is 0.4, 28 will be 3/5 which
27

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,830
is 0.6.
28

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,760
29 will be 4/5 which 0.8.
29

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,300
So notice here, 1/2, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5, is going to give us 1,
30

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,590
extra 1 so 6.
31

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,290
OK, this is like nice observation to keep in mind.
32

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,930
Moving to C++, when we divide two numbers and both of them are integer, then all the fractional
33

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,940
parts would be ignored.
34

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:02,070
So here dividing from 25 to 29/5.
35

36
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,090
It just the answer would be just 5, 30/5 is 6.
36

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,770
31/5 is also 6.
37

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,580
So two integer numbers divided by
38

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,240
We ignore the fractional part. On the other side,
39

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,210
If we use the double format or any one of them is double just one of them, if anyone is double then
40

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,160
the result is double.
41

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,160
Now we start to see the fractional part coming with you step by step 'till you grow up to the 6 here.
42

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,360
So the moral of that is, are you dividing two integers or one of them is double ? this decides the
43

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,770
final answer.
44

45
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,180
One of the very interesting observation is dividing integers by tens.
45

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,790
Let's see this number 12345.
46

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,380
Dividing it by 10
47

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,850
Give us 1234.
48

49
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,300
Why?
49

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,400
Because 12345
50

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,190
Divided by 10 is like 1234.5.
51

52
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,460
And in integer division, the point five just would be dropped.
52

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,190
Interestingly here, the relationship between 12345 and 1234
53

54
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,800
is that the last digit is removed.
54

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,030
Dividing by hundred will give us 123, dividing by thousand will give us 12, dividing
55

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,380
by this number, and so on.
56

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,510
So clearly dividing by 10, 100, 1000 is just removing numbers.
57

58
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,900
So dividing by 1000 is just removing the last 3 digits.
58

59
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,010
Dividing by 10000 is removing the last 4 digits.
59

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,070
If we use doubles this doesn't help, but it just we know that this fractional part is going to be divided,
60

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,240
dividing by 100000 end up with zero point the whole number.
61

62
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,340
So an integer part of this guy is just removed and we just did this one.
62

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,030
So keep this very important observation in your mind.
63

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,600
Dividing by 10s is just removing the last digit, last 2 digits, last 3 digits and so on.
64

65
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,800
Even and odd, even number is something that is divisible by 2, like 2, 4, 6 and so on.
65

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,290
If we divided a number by 2 and it is even then, there is no fractional part here.
66

67
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,050
So for example, 8 divided by 2 is 4, no fractional part.
67

68
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:19,950
on the other side, the odd numbers are numbers, that isn't divisible by 2, like 1, 3,
68

69
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,820
5, and so on.
69

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,620
When you divide such a number by 2, it will always has a fractional part 0.5.
70

71
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,010
So for example, 3 divided by 2 is 1.5.
71

72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,600
So the result of dividing these numbers over 2 is 1/2 = half, 3/2 = 1.5,  5/2
72

73
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,740
Is 2.5, and so on.
73

74
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,880
So this fractional part always exists.
74

75
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,070
So it's like number .5.
75

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:48,720
So dividing and even by 2, give us .0 dividing odd give us by .5.
76

77
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,280
It also worth highlighting about the conversions.
77

78
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,030
We can actually make conversions between numbers.
78

79
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's say that we divided here 8/3.
79

80
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,470
which gives us this big number 2.6666666 for infinity.
80

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,510
If we printed it, just we get this number and here it is approximated in C++.
81

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,020
Now look to this syntax,
82

83
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,560
We say here "int result = (int)num", this is called casting.
83

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,340
We are converting a double number to an integer number.
84

85
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,250
When we cast it, we just lose the fractional part.
85

86
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,460
So the .666 is just going to be lost.
86

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,810
So the result here would be 2. as we said before, even characters are internally represented as integers.
87

88
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,660
So if you casted a character to an integer,
88

89
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,430
it is  going to give you an integer value, interestingly, if we casted the small 'a' to the small 'z', we
89

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,550
get range 97 to 122.
90

91
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:58,840
If we casted the capital 'A' to the capital 'Z', we will have from 65 to 90.
91

92
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,290
There are two interesting observations here,
92

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,500
The first is that the upper case letters are smaller in value than the lower case letters.
93

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,950
This why we said before in comparison, capital words come before small words.
94

95
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,770
And the other thing that there is a range of characters from 'a' to 'z' and from 'A' to 'Z' here.
95

96
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,450
That's it.
