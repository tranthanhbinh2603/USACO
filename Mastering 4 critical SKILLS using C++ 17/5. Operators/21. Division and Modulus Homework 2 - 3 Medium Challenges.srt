00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,310
number two in the modulus and division, the first one "is even" I would like you to read the number integer
2

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,410
here and find the three ways that can tell us if a number is even or not.
3

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,750
The first one using the %2 only,
4

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,330
This is very direct, the second using the division over two and the third using the moduls 
5

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,910
10, feel free to write extra lines of code here.
6

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,280
But the purpose is using only division two, using only %10, we can figure out the answer.
7

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,360
So think about that.
8

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,270
The last 3 digits sum, you are to read an integer and print the sum
9

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,390
of its last three digits, for example, if there is 1,2,3,4 the last three digits are two,
10

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,380
three, four, which is nine here.
11

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,580
If you are reading something like 15, then it's like one five and like there are zeros here so one five
12

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,360
is just six.
13

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,020
And so on, and in this one, you will read an integer and print the 4th from the right side
14

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,350
For example, if we are reading numbers like this big number, count four from the end, one, two,
15

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,960
three, four.
16

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,890
So we print here four, one, two, zero four, one
17

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,560
here is the fourth
18

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,650
number five zero zero one five
19

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,700
here is the fifth number.
20

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,090
If the number doesn't exist, even like it's less than 4 digits, then you have to print a zero.
21

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,700
That's all.
