00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,960
Let's solve the first homework here, the first one is very straightforward, you should read the five
1

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,890
numbers requested from you and then the average is very easy, just sum all of them and divide by five.
2

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,070
observer here.
3

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,520
I use the double as my data type so that the average is working well.
4

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,710
This is the request a, the second request is a sum of the first three numbers divided by the sum of the second
5

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,860
two numbers, so far so good.
6

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,260
And finally, we would like also to get the first average over the second average.
7

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,200
So let's compute here.
8

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,290
First average over the second average.
9

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,250
that's all, if you thought about the relationship between B and C, you will observe that
10

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,990
C is 2/3 relationship like that.
11

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,430
This is mainly the relationship.
12

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,920
So if you try to divide them, you would observe that this  average would be cancelled with this,
13

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,620
this sum here would be cancelled with this sum and this sum would be cancelled with this sum so the
14

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,980
remain is just the three over two values, that's all.
15

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,150
In the second the program, the fractional part here, we would like to get the fractional part of a
16

17
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,550
number.
17

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,230
So the idea is let's first divide the two numbers together.
18

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,080
We got a result.
19

20
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,800
If we cast the result to integer, we got rid of the integer part.
20

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,370
For example, if we divided here and cast this to integer, we get the eight.
21

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,630
Now, if you subtracted all of this number from the eight, we will now get the fractional part here
22

23
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:52,540
From this subtraction. In the third program, we would like to get the remainder by ourselves, not by
23

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:52,940
the math.
24

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,600
The purpose of the assignment is to make sure that you understand and know the equation itself.
25

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,560
So let's put it here.
26

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,110
Let's try something like 13 over five.
27

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,830
If you did integer division for 13 / 5, you get two, which means
28

29
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,190
there are two complete cycles of five, which means two times five.
29

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,840
Ten is like the upper bound here.
30

31
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,730
Now, if you subtracted the 13 minus this 10, you get the result.
31

32
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,500
So this is how we can do it.
32

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,690
You do float division for N over M.
33

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,680
Now we extracted the two multiply
34

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,550
it with five.
35

36
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,550
Now you get the ten back, subtract thirteen minus ten, you get the three.
36

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,500
That's all, nothing more fancy than that.
