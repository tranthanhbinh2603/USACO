00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,960
The third homework set for the division and modulus, first one, and it is very similar to an old program
1

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,110
that we did, write a program that read an integer and the print either hundred, if the number
2

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,060
is even or seven if the number is odd.
3

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,670
So, for example, if I entered it, it would guarantee a 100 because it is even if the input is one
4

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,230
hundred thirty-three, the output will be seven because is odd, this is very similar to something we
5

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,740
did before.
6

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,970
The second one is about the years, assume a year is 12 a month and each month is just 30 days,
7

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,720
So the each year is just fixed it for three hundred and sixty days.
8

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,680
You will read an integer representing the total number of days of someone and you have to print 
9

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,120
three values, the total years, the total month and the remaining days.
10

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:56,310
For example, if someone is 360 days, then this means a single year, one year, zero month, zero days.
11

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,190
30 days mean one month.
12

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,440
10 days only been just 10 days here
13

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,190
0 years, 
14

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,700
Zero month.
15

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:12,210
If someone is 391 days, it means he is three hundred and sixty days for a year, 30 days for a
16

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,890
month, and then a single day and so on.
17

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,710
Please read the more examples if you are still confused about it.
18

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,060
That's all.
