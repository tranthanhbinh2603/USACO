1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,020
In the problem here.
1

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,940
We would like to get the forth digit from the back, which should have a very similar solution to
2

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,540
the last one.
3

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,100
Remember, if we kept dividing by 10, we are removing digits.
4

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,540
So dividing by 1000 is actually removing the last three digits at one
5

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,350
One step.
6

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,740
Now, if you took a modulus one for the remaining of this division, then you get the
7

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,030
fourth number.
8

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,780
Observer here,
9

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,070
I am having parenthesis here to give priority to the division first.
10

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,070
What if the number is less than three digits?
11

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,610
Then dividing it by ten will make it zero, zero modulus ten would be again zero.
12

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,940
So, it's safe to use this approach. That's all.
