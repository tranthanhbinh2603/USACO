00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,400
Before discussing the logical operator in the next video, it might worth to discuss first something in computer
1

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,990
science named as Truth Table.
2

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,630
This is something that you typically learn first in something like a discrete course.
3

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:23,010
And it's very intuitive, the first thing is something called the And operator '^'.
4

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,790
OK, let's say that I am 30 years old and my salary is 7000 and my weight is 120
5

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,290
kg.
6

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,740
If I told you that is Mostafa greater than 25 and his salary is less than 8000, you say
7

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,390
this is true.
8

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
If I told you is his
9

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,890
Age is greater than 27 and salary greater than 9000, you know that this is false, because Mostafa's salary
10

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,080
is just 7000.
11

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,530
So this is false information, but about 35 years and salary is less than 8500.
12

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,630
This is, again, false because this information is wrong.
13

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,330
And what about if Mostafa is greater than 35 and salary is greater than 9000?
14

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,870
This is false because the two conditions are false.
15

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,640
So now here in the logic of the word "AND" that we even use in our daily usage, we know that it will
16

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,270
not be really true unless both of them are true.
17

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,520
OK, in discrete we write it this way.
18

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,400
So we are now discussing programming or discussing basic logic. in the case of using the word
19

20
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,780
'And', we need both conditions to be true.
20

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,090
What about the "OR" case?
21

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,390
If I say is Mostafa greater than 25 or salary less than 8000, this is true because the
22

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,180
two conditions are true. is Mostafa greater than 27 years or salary greater than 9000.
23

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,430
This is true because I satisfied this condition.
24

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,950
And same here, I will be true because I satisfy this condition.
25

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,420
What about is Mostafa greater than 35 or salary greater than 9000?
26

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,190
This is false, because the two conditions are false.
27

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,300
So this is, again, from our daily semantic.
28

29
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,640
So, when we use the word "or", we actually need at least one that is true.
29

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,500
In other words, the answer would be false if both of them would be false.
30

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,350
So this is how we differentiate between the "AND" and between the "OR". this table is what we call the logical table.
31

32
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,860
It's kind of a summary to what we were saying. in the "AND" case,
32

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,790
if this condition is true, like greater than 25 years old and this condition
33

34
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,110
is true, then overall is true. if there is one missing condition,
34

35
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,390
In the end it ends up with false.
35

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,210
The "OR" case's is different.
36

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,290
If anyone is true, then it can be true.
37

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,810
Otherwise, if both of them are false,
38

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,890
It can be false.
39

40
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,380
The reverse of true is false.
40

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,730
The not of false is true.
41

42
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,760
This is the the the not operator that we know.
42

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:13,550
So now this is the AND table and the OR table for the two cases that we were just learning in the previous
43

44
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,000
slides.
44

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,060
Please make sure that you understand very carefully that, and you know what I mainly saied.
45

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,270
there is one case here to be true only. there is one case here to be false only.
46

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,590
So make sure that you understand it.
47

48
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,760
Now, let's expand it for three variables, OK, in a very similar way.
48

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,790
In the AND case, there will be only one case
49

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,240
that's true, when all of them are true.
50

51
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,050
OK, one here for true.
51

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,870
Otherwise we have all of them false.
52

53
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,260
In the OR case, there is only one case that is zero or false when all of them are false, otherwise
53

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,150
all of them are true.
54

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,640
So this is clearly the difference between the AND and OR. so the AND and OR Truth Tables are corresponding
55

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:02,690
to our human logic when it comes also to the AND and the OR. if you are applying to the college and I'm
56

57
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,510
putting for you conditions about your family income, your current age, your current weight
57

58
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,040
or something like that. I'm putting some conditions for you and telling you, are
58

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,520
you satisfying all of them or are you satisfying one of them.
59

60
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,560
This is like our normal logic.
60

61
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,450
And here is some example about what we're saying, but more than three variables, so is Mustafa
61

62
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,580
greater than 25 and salary less than 8000 and weight is less than 150 kg.
62

63
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,390
To make it simpler for yourself, start with simplifying to true and false.
63

64
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,220
Is Mostafa greater than 25,
64

65
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,610
True.
65

66
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,220
And salary less than 8000, true.
66

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,100
And weight less than 150KG),                                                                                                                                                   true.
67

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,050
We have ANDs, we know in AND we need all of them to be true.
68

69
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,020
So all of them true ?
69

70
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,990
Yes, then true.
70

71
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,890
Now here's another condition we simplified it to
71

72
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,000
True, true, true.
72

73
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,550
then also true. in here we have a simplified to true, true, false.
73

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,820
This is going to be false because we need all of them to be true. here,
74

75
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,250
false or true or false.
75

76
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,190
This is now the OR we need one of them to be true,
76

77
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,820
to be true.
77

78
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,830
So this is true.
78

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,120
So the answer is true. false OR false OR
79

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,660
False,
80

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,910
All of them are false.
81

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,440
And in our case, then it would be false.
82

83
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,040
So what if we have a mix of AND and OR, how do we as humans do it?
83

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,540
But let's say I said Mostafa greater than 35 or salary greater than 6000 or weight is greater than...this the previous
84

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
case, false or true or false,
85

86
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,580
This is true.
86

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,510
But now what about that false AND true OR false?
87

88
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,370
We as humans mainly we try to group first the ANDs together.
88

89
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,480
So it ends up like you are thinking is Mostafa greater than 35 years and salary greater than 6000? or his
89

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,180
weight is greater than 200 kg.
90

91
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,650
We then think about this condition first.
91

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,760
So we take this false AND true, and solve it first.
92

93
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,560
False AND true is false.
93

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,480
OK, false AND true is false.
94

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,410
Now we remove false AND true, and replace it with false.
95

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,110
So false OR false is false.
96

97
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,440
Another case, let's say, for this expression, we simplified it to true AND true AND true
97

98
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,310
OR false.
98

99
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,650
Then we solve the ANDs group first.
99

100
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,780
So this is like a priority. true AND true AND true,
100

101
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,760
we solve it to true. true OR false,
101

102
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,830
we solve it to true.
102

103
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,380
So this is how we simplify a big expression.
103

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,370
So in summary, if all conditions are ANDed, then it would be true,
104

105
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,870
If all of them are true. if all conditions are ORed, it would be true if any one of them true; false
105

106
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,360
if all of them are false.
106

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,600
If you have a mix, of ORs and ANDs, find each subgroup of ANDs, evaluate it first, then do
107

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,660
the normal ORing for the remaining.
108

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,530
Please make sure that you are comfortable with today's session before the next lesson.
109

110
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,760
That's it.
