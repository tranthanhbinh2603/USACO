00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,810
The third homework, we already did something very similar to that guy, we would like to find an equation
1

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,980
that helps us to cancel one part out of the two.
2

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,710
So I'm developing here something that say is_even and is_odd and multiplying by 100 and by seven and is_odd
3

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,610
is just one minus is_even.
4

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,260
So if is_even is one then odd is zero, is_even is zero, then is odd is one.
5

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,500
So now only one of these two parts would be activated, either that part or that part, and based on 
6

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,410
that we will get back the answer. Again, in the future,
7

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,740
The code of that should be much more trivial than that.
8

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,780
In the second problem, we have to apply a lot of modulus and division to extract the the three components
9

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,900
that we asked for them.
10

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,580
So let's see how to do that in a short way.
11

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,110
I expect that you wrote several lines of code to do it, but here is one shorter way than what you did.
12

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,090
Observe
13

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,280
First, if you would like to get the exact number of years, all what you need is to divide by three
14

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,240
hundred and thirties.
15

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,030
For example, if you have something like three hundred ninety-one and you divided it by three hundred
16

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,390
and thirty here, you will get something like one point zero something.
17

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,280
So we know that there is at least one year here.
18

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,740
That's why the integer division is going to get for us the number of years. Now,
19

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,680
I would like to get the remaining after removing the number of years, I can do that by days modulus
20

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,260
60.
21

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,900
Now, this is the total number of days for the month and for the days, for example, here, if we have
22

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,670
three hundred ninety-one and we take it modulus three hundred and sixty, it would be 31.
23

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,180
This is the remaining of the total number of days and month.
24

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,440
Now, in a very similar logic, we can again divide by 30 to get the number of months, then mod 30 to extract
25

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,900
the number of exact days.
26

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,680
That's all.
