1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's solve this problem, which is all about tracing mainly. for the first
1

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:16,740
problem here, we have mainly variables A and B, with two zeroes, and then we are printing
2

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,320
A++,  ++ after the A means that the A original value will be used
3

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,030
first then it will be incremented.
4

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,620
So A is zero.
5

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,140
So zero would be printed here and then B++ would be done after the 'cout'  statement.
6

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,360
So after here at nine eight, the value of A now is one.
7

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,020
Then we have ++A, ++A will increment A first before using it and A is one,
8

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,650
So now A is two, then we print it,
9

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,760
That's why we have two, we were one plus one two.
10

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:59,810
Now, A + 2 * B + 1, B is 1, 2 * 1 is 2 + 1 is 3 and
11

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,680
then 3 + A which is 2, is 5.
12

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:11,450
So now A is 5 and then B = ++A * 2, A is 5, ++A will increment it
13

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:11,910
first.
14

15
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,780
So A will be 6 and then 6 * 2 will be 12.
15

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,770
If we printed here A and B, we will notice then they are 6 and 12, for A and B. assigning B to A
16

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,110
then
17

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,300
Now the two values are 6 and 6.
18

19
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,550
A = new value for A, 12 +A / 3 will compute all of this expression, then assign it here
19

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:42,210
to the value of A, A is 6, 6 / 3 is  2, 2 / 2 is 1, and then 12 + 1
20

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,100
is a 13.
21

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,290
13 - 4 is 9
22

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,970
So printing here 9.
23

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,490
And observe here, in math this three lines must  be done together the A / by 3 by 2.
24

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,170
In math the division will have higher priority and also the multiplication would have the higher priority.
25

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,420
So in math you should do first this expression then this expression then you do all of it.
26

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,550
So anyway,
27

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,560
Now the B is 6 and A is 9.
28

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,700
Now we are assigning A again to B, which is 6.
29

30
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,760
So A is now 6
30

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,450
And here we say 12 + 6.
31

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,580
The parenthesis will give higher priority.
32

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,120
So it will be applied first, 12 + 6 is 8, sorry, 12 + 6 is 18.
33

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,790
/ 3 is 9 or 18
34

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,220
/ 3 is 6,  / 2 is 3
35

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,380
So this whole expression
36

37
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,180
Here is 3.
37

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,740
3 - 2 is 1
38

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,870
Then 1*2 is 2, printing here 2 again, in terms of priority, the parenthesis will have
39

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,560
higher priority.
40

41
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,770
So this is very deep
41

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,990
One will be done first, then the remaining of the division will be done here second,
42

43
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,620
Then we will subtract by 2.
43

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,720
Then finally we multiply by 2.
44

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,030
It's important to know how to trace things like that.
45

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,450
Let's move to the second homework again.
46

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,380
Another tracing.
47

48
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,370
This tracing is mainly the Fibonacci tracing, we already took such a program and we referred to Fibonacci before.
48

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,820
If the first term of Fibonacci is A, and the second term of Fibonacci is B, then C here is = A + b is just
49

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,460
assigning the term intermediate.
50

51
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,990
And the moral of this assignment is just to observe that we have to print to the last value here.
51

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,550
Remember that the comma operator is evaluated from left to right.
52

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,510
This one is evaluated
53

54
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,990
This one,
54

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,410
This one,
55

56
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,830
This one,
56

57
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,250
This one,
57

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,610
This one,
58

59
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:33,940
This one.
59

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,270
And so on till we are done with this guy and we print it.
60

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,250
So in the comma we print the last one.
61

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,990
The comma operator is one of the least used in industry in this type.
62

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,910
And it is good to know about it.
63

64
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:55,930
And the third homework, we have another tracing, so let's see here what we have, it's merely an exercise
64

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,400
over the compound assignments.
65

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,650
We start with A as 210
66

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,770
If we divide A by 2, then the 200 would be 100 the 10 would be 5.
67

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,900
So overall would be one 105
68

69
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,950
105 actually is the multiplication of three values, 3 and 5 and 7.
69

70
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,130
If you divide it by 3, you will get 35.
70

71
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,320
Then by 5 you get 7.
71

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,090
Then by 7 you get 1.
72

73
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,570
And all of these operations involve the "/=".
73

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,730
So A is updated with every step.
74

75
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,990
This is an independent expression.
75

76
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,020
Too we have here these parameters have priority would be applied first, these parameters have priority would be applied
76

77
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,320
first, these parameters would be applied first, 2 +3 is 5, 5 - (-3) is 8.
77

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,660
So we have actually 5 * 8, then divided by 5 and divided by 8 , so actually overall
78

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,380
is 1.
79

80
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,980
We start here with A = 10, then A++ + 10.
80

81
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,930
it starts by addition.
81

82
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,520
A is 10 and 10 is 20, and this (++) would be done later.
82

83
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,170
So this would have to print 20. and then
83

84
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,140
now A is 11 and here we have again A + 10,
84

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,930
So you can think like oh A is 11,
85

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,620
11 and 10 is 21. and this will be applied first, then we have 22, so we have here overall
86

87
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:28,180
22. and A is now 12. and then the same concept here as we incremented A twice
87

88
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,600
and decremented twice then we are sure that A is now just 10.
88

89
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,750
So A is 10 and B is 20.
89

90
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:42,870
Let's add them A + B, A is 10, B is 20 then 30. and the ++B is incremented first,
90

91
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,440
then the B will have to be 1 early, so the output would have to be 31.
91

92
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,270
And we are printing the A here, which is 11 from this expression.
92

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,220
And finally this ugly statement, ++A += 10.
93

94
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,960
I wrote it in this fancy way to confuse you. you are incrementing the A first and then you are adding
94

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,630
the value to it. in industry we shouldn't try to code in a way that confuse people.
95

96
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,740
This is fair enough,
96

97
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,910
People will perceive it.
97

98
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,040
Such an expression might be a bit longer for guys, so you might divide it to several variables.
98

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
This are OK, OK expressions because there is only a single variable is changed here.
99

100
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,600
However, for clarity, you might consider making this say ++A in a separate line first or taking
100

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,590
a copy from that one.
101

102
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,090
You do not code in this way, and you don't code in this way. over all
102

103
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,540
You have to think in industry about your colleagues who are reading
103

104
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,770
code. even you after like six months, you might come back to read the code.
104

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,940
the code has to be clear.
105

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,700
So make sure to write something that is really clear.
106

107
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,680
If you are writing a line of code that isn't clear enough, it's a good idea to come and write some
107

108
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,310
comment here for the guys to give them some help, that's all.
