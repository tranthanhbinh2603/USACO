00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,630
For the homework of the logical operators, the first step is to guess the output of all of this program.
1

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,400
and then run it and make a comparison, in the second step, you are to creating a line of code for all
2

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,150
of these cases.
3

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,020
Assume, go ahead and read 3 integers, one for the number of boys, number of girls and number of teachers
4

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,830
in some classroom.
5

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,290
Then for every one of them, I would like you to figure out how to write a code that expresses it.
6

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,900
So this is more about converting logic to code.
7

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,300
So you say, for example, number of boys greater than 25, do an statement for that.
8

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,910
So every statement read it and decide the statement for it here we say, for example, the difference between
9

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,910
number of boys, and number of girls is more than 10 or number of teachers is greater than 5 and so
10

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,020
on.
11

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,760
So read every line and create a line of code for it, the final thing is a simplification.
12

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,700
Take every line of these guys and simplify it by hand, step by step and tell if they are true
13

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,210
or false.
14

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,220
Then you optionally write a line of code to verify if your simplification is correct or not.
15

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,330
That's it.
