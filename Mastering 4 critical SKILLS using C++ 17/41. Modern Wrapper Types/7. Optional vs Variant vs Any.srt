00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,070
Let's make some comparison between the three three rappers that we learned.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,260
As you know, the institutional Ismailiya, when you have something may exist or may not, but the verdict

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,830
is when you have several data types, but only one of them is available at any time, anything on any

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,330
trial for that can hold anything of them.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,080
But you are advised to use it.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,600
Unless there is, there is no way to avoid it.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,160
From the memory perspective, both variant and optional don't require any extra, no allocations.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,630
Behind the scene, remember, for variant, the memories the legends member, but for any there is extra

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,020
memory allocations that happen from time to time.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,490
If the data types are very primitives, then this will not allocate memory types.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,680
But for larger objects, this will typically allocate memory types for you.

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,810
So you have to be careful with any as it is like it can consume your memory if it has been to use it

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,950
a lot with different objects.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,060
From miniaturisation, prospective by default, variant is initialized with the first time.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,480
And remember, we talk about the model state and it can help us to avoid initializing the first variable

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,120
optional on the other side is usually initialized to an empty optional.

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,190
Remember that both variant and optional can work with objects, even if it doesn't have the Kobe and

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:36,880
new functionalities, however, is the DNA cannot the object must be copyable and must be movable.

19
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,260
In terms of the FBI, let's say you're dealing with an FBI when you see guys are using, say, for example,

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,920
variant, they are giving you a signal that this FBI allow to return to different options.

21
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,230
But what of the FBI that you are using?

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,770
Is returning any this is now very risky.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,730
You will probably have to have to go and read the code or the documentation by yourself to know what

24
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,130
are these guys exactly returning so any can be a bit scary in the eyes.

25
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,870
And you have to think and have to read the commission to make sure that you understand what these guys

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,530
are going to do

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,680
before.

28
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:22,030
And C++ any is a replacement for what we call avoid point or explain that in the modern pointer topics.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,470
But you do need to learn it.

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,540
And also, as I said, the variant is like a replacement to The Onion, which you do need to replace

31
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,670
it.

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,610
The point behind this model is more flexibility, simpler good and several choices in implementation.

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,880
That's it.
