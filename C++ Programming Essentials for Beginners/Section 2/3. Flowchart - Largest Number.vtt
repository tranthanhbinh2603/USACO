00:01.260 --> 00:06.090
So in this lecture, we are going to discuss this problem, given three numbers, we have to find the

00:06.090 --> 00:07.590
largest of them, OK?

00:08.100 --> 00:13.610
For example, we have a number 10, we have a number 30 and we have a number 22.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.730
Obviously, we know the largest in this case is the middle man.

00:18.270 --> 00:22.830
This is the largest number because we have to print the largest of the three numbers.

00:22.860 --> 00:27.570
Another example would be, let's say we have 12 eight to 10.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.770
In this case, the largest is the number 12.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.900
So let's see how we can draw a flowchart to find the largest of these numbers.

00:37.810 --> 00:41.640
The first step, as we're discussing every problem, would be a start.

00:42.270 --> 00:46.020
The next step would be to read the values of these three numbers.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.850
OK, whatever it is, the input, we are going to read it, for example, into the input as.

00:52.270 --> 01:00.520
Then, well, I need this input would be fed to the system by using a read statement, OK, in the next

01:00.520 --> 01:00.880
step.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.160
That would be a comparison to what we can do.

01:03.170 --> 01:11.230
We can check if it is greater than equal to be and is greater than equal to see if this is.

01:11.320 --> 01:16.000
If this condition is true, that means we are checking is then greater than both.

01:16.030 --> 01:16.510
12.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.610
And it is also greater than equal to it.

01:21.970 --> 01:23.980
Obviously, this condition is not true.

01:24.910 --> 01:30.280
But if this is true to what we can do, we can simply print and exit.

01:30.430 --> 01:32.290
That means our work gets done.

01:32.780 --> 01:39.610
So we can say in this case, if it is like 12, then indeed we know that 12 is greater than or equal

01:39.610 --> 01:43.150
to 10 and 12 is also greater than or equal to eight.

01:43.480 --> 01:43.770
OK.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.870
So in this case, we will separate eight and end or exit whatever it is.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.590
But if it is not the case, what does it mean, OK?

01:53.920 --> 02:00.640
So this basically means, let's say the numbers are 10, 12 and eight, so is clearly not an option.

02:00.940 --> 02:02.150
It cannot be on it.

02:02.710 --> 02:05.700
So what we will do, we will take for be gone.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.140
We believe it answered.

02:07.540 --> 02:14.650
In order to have real as ever answered what we can do, we can check that if B is greater than or equal

02:14.650 --> 02:18.590
to A and B is greater than or equal to C, OK.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.200
This is the case.

02:20.650 --> 02:23.700
If we go into this direction of yours begins OK.

02:24.310 --> 02:32.200
B is the answer identifies if it is not the greatest B is not the greatest, then B must be the greatest.

02:32.200 --> 02:32.440
OK?

02:32.830 --> 02:36.100
So in this case, we will say print c and exit.

02:36.100 --> 02:45.220
OK, now you may ask why I'm using this greater than equal to sign why not only greater than is sufficient.

02:45.220 --> 02:46.450
OK, let's see.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.240
The numbers are equal.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.470
For example, let's say the numbers are.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.060
Twenty.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.420
Twenty twenty and.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.890
It's been OK.

03:03.300 --> 03:10.080
If this is the case, though, if you only use the statement greater than, OK, so for 2020 and then

03:10.710 --> 03:17.700
obviously this condition would be false when there is not greater than 20, this condition would also

03:17.700 --> 03:18.300
be false.

03:18.810 --> 03:22.290
B is not greater than what would happen in this case.

03:22.770 --> 03:29.700
We will end up in the last branch of the code and we will separate the two, which which will output

03:29.700 --> 03:30.690
bend in this case.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.770
So which is wrong?

03:32.160 --> 03:38.580
That is why in this flowchart, we are writing a modification that while making this check, we are

03:38.580 --> 03:41.750
checking whether the number is greater than or equal to.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.640
So this symbol is known as greater than or equal to.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.390
So if 20 is greater than equal to 20, the answer would be yes.

03:48.750 --> 03:56.190
So if the numbers are like 2020 and then so what you will do in the first check you will check is 20

03:56.190 --> 04:01.440
greater than equal to 20 yes, and 20 is greater than or equal to 10.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.850
Yes, we will print a and you will.

04:04.860 --> 04:08.950
And in this case, your output would be this number 20.

04:09.540 --> 04:15.990
I hope you have understood the flowchart to find out the largest of three numbers, and that's all for

04:15.990 --> 04:16.560
this we do.
