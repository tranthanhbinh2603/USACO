00:01.420 --> 00:03.820
I assume now we will try out another problem.

00:04.060 --> 00:08.350
The problem is given a number we want to check if it is a prime number or not.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.890
Let us quickly recap what is the prime number to?

00:11.890 --> 00:17.140
A prime number is a number that has only two dividers, one and the number itself, OK?

00:17.530 --> 00:23.950
If you're given and and it has only two dividers, one and the number itself, then it is a prime number.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.620
Few examples of prime numbers.

00:26.890 --> 00:33.430
For example, seven to only one in seven divide seven the number 11, only one and 11 divide the number

00:33.430 --> 00:33.820
11.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.990
Or talk about the number like 13, only one and 13.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.250
Divide this number.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.680
So only one end to divide.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.180
So all of them.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.040
Numbers are prime numbers.

00:46.700 --> 00:54.860
So what is a non prime number, so a non prime number will have at least one device it in the range

00:55.190 --> 00:56.330
to do and minus one?

00:56.510 --> 00:56.840
OK.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.370
At least one device that in the range.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.850
To do and minus one.

01:04.040 --> 01:11.560
So why do two and minus one, because you have seen that one and then divide all the numbers, they

01:11.560 --> 01:12.580
divide prime numbers.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.440
They also divide non-prime numbers.

01:14.450 --> 01:22.720
But if you have, at least one divides it in this range, starting from two up to n minus one.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.080
OK.

01:23.560 --> 01:30.910
If you find at least one it here, then you can see that this number is a non prime number.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.440
OK, this number is a non brand.

01:33.700 --> 01:41.290
For example, the number nine, so it has a divisor in the range to do it and the divide that history,

01:41.890 --> 01:43.030
the three divides nine.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.010
So you get to nine Model three.

01:45.670 --> 01:46.450
This is zero.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.290
And.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.080
Nine is a non prime number.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.240
Talk about the number 14.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.500
So two divides.

01:54.530 --> 01:55.060
14.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.930
And this is not brain, OK?

01:58.960 --> 02:05.710
Seven also divides 14, but we need to find only at least one device that will get one device that is

02:05.710 --> 02:09.700
sufficient to prove the number is not brain.

02:10.270 --> 02:13.390
Now, given a number, we need to check if it is prime or not.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.210
Can we come up with a very simple logic?

02:17.510 --> 02:19.070
Approval a no is prime or not.

02:19.550 --> 02:30.050
Yes, logic would be that we can try to find out divisor in the range to do and minus one phone, find

02:30.050 --> 02:33.530
out or devise it in the range.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.820
It will do and minus one, if the device that is found, if you are able to get a device it.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.000
Then, yes, the number is not prime.

02:45.630 --> 02:45.960
OK.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.020
And if the device that is not found.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.680
Then you can set the numbers right.

02:54.330 --> 02:54.590
OK.

02:54.960 --> 03:00.990
This is how simple it is to prove a number is primal, not knowing what you can do is you can take a

03:00.990 --> 03:06.420
pause and try to think of a flowchart approval numbers game or not.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.490
OK, so let us try.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.200
The first step, as we discussed, would be a start.

03:15.610 --> 03:23.890
Then we will try to read the value of the number that we want to prove as prime or not will read the

03:23.890 --> 03:24.640
value of an.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.870
The next step would be what?

03:29.020 --> 03:29.590
We need to.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.990
Find advisor in the range to do and minus one, OK?

03:34.500 --> 03:38.800
That means we will need a loop in this range.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.290
It will do and minus one.

03:40.940 --> 03:41.580
Let us take.

03:41.610 --> 03:47.660
I'm currently at the no I initialize my eyes to.

03:48.810 --> 03:49.070
I will.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.430
OK, I used to.

03:51.870 --> 03:58.080
And now what I will do, I trade buildings I as less than equal to minus one.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.720
This is my stopping point of life.

04:01.460 --> 04:06.060
I will take if I is less than equal to and minus one.

04:06.180 --> 04:11.850
So this will go inside diamond at because it's a condition.

04:13.010 --> 04:16.500
If it is less than equal, then minus one, OK?

04:17.030 --> 04:23.390
If the case is yes or if the case is no, OK, we'll see what will happen in each of these cases if

04:23.390 --> 04:25.190
it's less than equal one minus one.

04:25.640 --> 04:31.340
Then what we will do will try to divide and with I and find out the remainder.

04:31.700 --> 04:38.600
We will check will give and is divisible by alternate will again put in either condition and that if

04:38.900 --> 04:43.970
conditions, if I is if modulus I.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.130
If this is equal to zero.

04:47.790 --> 04:53.370
Now again, two things can happen, Don, that again, we know or the answer can be yes.

04:55.560 --> 05:03.600
OK, now, if the answer is yes, what we can do, we can simply say that this number is a prime number.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.050
OK?

05:04.830 --> 05:10.470
This number is is not the prime number because, for example, talk about the number nine and you reach

05:10.830 --> 05:11.550
three to nine.

05:11.550 --> 05:12.780
Model three is zero.

05:13.140 --> 05:20.670
And hence, you can see that this number is not prime, so you can print that this is a not prime number.

05:22.270 --> 05:22.960
And Jordan.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.390
You're done at this point.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.240
OK, so what are you going to do?

05:29.270 --> 05:31.160
You're going straight, go to exit.

05:32.490 --> 05:35.520
You can safely exit the program from this particular point.

05:36.690 --> 05:41.190
But what if, if it is not OK, if it is no, then what you're going to do?

05:42.360 --> 05:46.260
So you are going to say, don't let it.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.140
It might be possible that the end is not divisible by two.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.080
It might be divisible by three.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.220
So you are going to take it to the next place.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.390
We are doing this.

05:54.390 --> 05:54.680
OK?

05:55.290 --> 05:57.600
Let us increment is a plus one.

05:58.680 --> 06:03.000
And now what we are doing, we are again going to connect back here.

06:03.330 --> 06:03.660
OK.

06:04.770 --> 06:08.100
Again, we are going to connect back here again.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.650
We will go to the next day.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.620
We will check if that is less than equal to and minus one.

06:12.630 --> 06:15.820
If it is yes, if it is divisible print, not prime.

06:16.070 --> 06:20.750
Otherwise, we increment day and we again do the same thing again.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.030
OK?

06:21.960 --> 06:25.710
Now finally, if you come out of this direction, OK?

06:26.430 --> 06:29.580
So in what case you will come out of this?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.230
No direction, OK?

06:31.350 --> 06:32.100
So can you think?

06:33.250 --> 06:40.480
In what NATO, you will come out of it, the only scenario in which you will come out of from this blog

06:40.480 --> 06:47.110
is via this error is when you do not exit the loop through inside this direction, OK?

06:47.560 --> 06:56.410
That means we could not find a device that in the range to do and minus one that could divide and and

06:56.410 --> 07:04.530
hence from here you can say OK, if it is, if I has reached this value, you can simply say print name.

07:06.690 --> 07:10.130
And then you can simply do exit, OK?

07:10.470 --> 07:12.540
Or you can connect to the same exit here.

07:13.050 --> 07:13.800
Not an issue.

07:14.550 --> 07:19.740
Now let us try to brighten this flow chart for value of any call to seven.

07:19.740 --> 07:27.060
OK, let's see what happens for an equal to seven eyes, to the words less than equal to six or two

07:27.060 --> 07:28.290
is less than equal to six.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.320
Is seven divisible by two than it is?

07:31.320 --> 07:31.620
No.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.800
So you increment right?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.250
So the eye becomes three.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.700
OK, the eye becomes three.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.060
Three is less than equal to six.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.640
Is seven divisible by three boundaries?

07:41.640 --> 07:41.910
No.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.990
So you again come here are equal to eight plus one.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.210
You again go back here, OK, via this route.

07:49.590 --> 07:52.020
So I is known for the Xenical.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.510
Six seven is not divisible by four.

07:55.110 --> 07:56.250
It becomes five.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.780
Five is less than equal to six.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.580
Seven is not divisible by five.

08:00.060 --> 08:00.810
Again, no.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.810
You come here and it becomes six.

08:05.070 --> 08:08.310
Texas, less than equal to six seven, is not divisible by six.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.510
And that is no.

08:10.140 --> 08:12.420
And the value of, I know becomes seven.

08:12.990 --> 08:18.840
So when you when you now come here, OK, so I is seven, which is not less than equal than minus one.

08:19.560 --> 08:25.920
Hence, you come out of this brand and you print that it is a premium, but hence you say, OK, the

08:25.920 --> 08:28.230
number seven is a prime number.

08:28.320 --> 08:28.620
OK.

08:30.630 --> 08:35.260
And then we exit, so it would have been some of the no like nine.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.020
So you would have been OK.

08:37.950 --> 08:42.030
There was less than equal to eight, but nine is not divisible by two.

08:43.210 --> 08:49.060
Make it three trees less than equal to eight and nine more, three is zero.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.770
You come here.

08:51.220 --> 08:54.780
Then you hit a yes, your brain does not break and then you exert.

08:55.270 --> 09:00.390
Then guess of nine, you will print that this number is not plain, OK?

09:01.000 --> 09:07.730
So I hope this flowchart is now clear to you and your understood how we have implemented a loop.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.990
OK, so what barred from the loop this box?

09:12.420 --> 09:17.250
Is the starting point of the new book, if this is just a condition inside the loop?

09:17.700 --> 09:19.590
This is just a condition inside a loop.

09:20.640 --> 09:20.940
OK?

09:21.750 --> 09:26.160
This part is the starting point of the loop, which has this stopping criteria.

09:26.730 --> 09:30.570
Here we have the update condition, and this part is the work then.

09:30.660 --> 09:30.960
OK.

09:32.710 --> 09:36.460
So that's all for this video, I hope you understood the concept.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.300
Thank you.
