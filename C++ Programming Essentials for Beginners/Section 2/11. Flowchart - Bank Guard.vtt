00:01.470 --> 00:06.840
OK, here is a quick thinking problem for you, so you have to draw a flowchart for a bank security

00:06.840 --> 00:07.120
guard.

00:07.140 --> 00:12.420
OK, so the bank security guard is going to wait for the customers outside the bank.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.670
And if they're coming before 6:00 p.m., it will add the customers to the queue.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.460
Otherwise, it will keep on waiting.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.750
And if time reaches six p.m., he is going to close the bank.

00:23.780 --> 00:28.980
OK, so this was this video and think how you are going to build this flow chart?

00:28.980 --> 00:29.200
OK?

00:29.970 --> 00:32.220
Now let's talk about the solution.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.530
The solution would look something like this.

00:34.950 --> 00:35.820
The bank is open.

00:36.900 --> 00:42.510
And the security guard is going to take every dime, is it 6pm or not, if it's six p.m.?

00:42.870 --> 00:46.510
If the answer is yes, he is going to close the bank if it is not.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.710
He's going to check whether there is a customer waiting outside the bank.

00:49.860 --> 00:53.430
If yes, is going to add the customer to the queue.

00:53.830 --> 00:57.900
OK, so this is how it goes, like at the customer to the queue.

00:58.590 --> 01:02.100
And that's that's the work of the security guard.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.120
OK, if you are not worried, what will happen to the customer?

01:05.130 --> 01:08.370
That is a part of a separate flow given to enters the bank.

01:09.060 --> 01:14.310
So then, after doing both the steps where the customer is waiting or not, he will.

01:14.430 --> 01:17.920
He will continuously check when to close the bank.

01:18.790 --> 01:20.340
So he's always looking at his watch.

01:20.670 --> 01:23.340
What is their time if there is a customer added to the queue?

01:23.340 --> 01:24.120
Look at the time.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.110
If it is, if no customer is waiting again, look at what is their time will give.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.250
So he's doing these two steps repeatedly.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.050
OK, so this part is inside a loop continuously.

01:37.050 --> 01:37.800
Look at the time.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.750
And if there is a customer in time added to the queue, if there is not a customer, look at the time,

01:42.750 --> 01:43.010
OK?

01:43.860 --> 01:48.180
So in both the cases, after adding to the customer, he looked at time on other ways as well.

01:48.930 --> 01:52.830
And as soon as time reaches six p.m., he is going to close the bank.

01:53.190 --> 01:53.760
That's all.

01:53.770 --> 01:57.210
That's a pretty simple flowchart of a security guard of a bank.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.280
I hope you understood this one as well.
