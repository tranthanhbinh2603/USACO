Everyone.

00:02.490 --> 00:08.190
So let us discuss this problem of finding simple interest and in order to compute simple interest,

00:09.030 --> 00:12.060
we need three things we need to know the principal amount.

00:12.570 --> 00:15.300
The rate of interest on diamond years.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.080
And if given to these three things, you can simply compute the simple interest OK.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.610
So you might have done it in school level maths.

00:24.240 --> 00:32.070
We also know the formula for simple interest is given as principal that is denoted using be multiplied,

00:32.070 --> 00:36.300
but it multiplied by time and divided by 100 OK.

00:36.810 --> 00:42.780
For example, if your principal is 100, the rate is five and dime is two.

00:43.470 --> 00:50.820
And if you divide it with 100, it gives you the value, then it gives you the value and.

00:52.570 --> 00:55.240
Now, this is what the simple interest is.

00:55.270 --> 01:01.690
Now suppose we want to write a program or we want to write a flowchart for this problem.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.270
Let's see what steps we have to follow.

01:05.290 --> 01:11.740
So as we discussed, the first step would always be start, OK, the next step in this problem is to

01:11.740 --> 01:16.450
take input because once you have the input only, then you can process your data.

01:17.020 --> 01:20.080
That will take input and we will read three numbers.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.200
That is the principal date and time.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.550
OK, so doing this step will create three buckets in the memory.

01:27.940 --> 01:30.760
OK, so one bucket will store the principal.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.920
Another bucket will store the read.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.160
Another bucket will store the name.

01:35.500 --> 01:40.540
OK, and now we are saying that, OK, we are going to process simple interest.

01:40.690 --> 01:45.370
So we are creating another bucket whose name is simple interest.

01:45.910 --> 01:50.060
And we are evaluating the value of this expression.

01:50.080 --> 01:56.770
So we are multiplying three numbers 1.5 and two dividing it with a constant that is under it, and we

01:56.770 --> 02:03.240
are storing the result here that is going to store the value in here.

02:03.280 --> 02:03.570
OK.

02:04.030 --> 02:10.600
That means if we deposit 200 rupees at a five percent interest for a period of two years, we will get.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.990
Ben Rubies as a simple interest.

02:15.080 --> 02:22.550
So let's see, let's put it in the simple interest that will bring the value of this bucket that Dennis

02:22.550 --> 02:23.060
printed.

02:23.690 --> 02:27.380
And here we were, consuming three inputs under advisement.

02:28.010 --> 02:28.310
OK.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.140
They go as input.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.020
And this simple interest is the output.

02:33.410 --> 02:34.160
And that's it.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.600
Now we are done with the process and hence we write them.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.430
And that's it.

02:39.470 --> 02:41.990
That is how simple it is to draw a flowchart.

02:42.020 --> 02:45.170
So I hope this problem is clear for you in the next video.
