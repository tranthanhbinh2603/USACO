00:01.480 --> 00:06.700
Alright, so let us do one more problem on flowcharts and this problem, we want to find the greatest

00:06.700 --> 00:08.410
common divisor of two numbers, OK?

00:08.950 --> 00:12.060
And it is also known as DCD on Etsy.

00:12.080 --> 00:19.140
If, for example, let's say there is a number that is eight, it is a number B that has led to 12.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.550
So what is the largest number that divides both of these numbers?

00:23.560 --> 00:23.800
OK.

00:24.730 --> 00:25.660
So by.

00:26.890 --> 00:29.200
And division we can do this number is nothing went forward.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.460
What is the largest number that will divide eight and 12 would.

00:34.060 --> 00:37.930
OK, for example, is eight and B is letter 24.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.990
In this case, the DCT would be nothing but it because it divides aid.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.120
And it also divides 24.

00:47.110 --> 00:51.100
And maybe there is a no, let's say is nine.

00:51.850 --> 01:01.360
And let's be is living in this case, the desert is one that is no common divisor except one between

01:01.360 --> 01:02.320
the two numbers, OK?

01:03.160 --> 01:11.410
So if you look carefully, you can see that if you have a number a, it's A and a No.

01:11.410 --> 01:11.680
B.

01:12.710 --> 01:21.790
We can clearly see that the DCD of these numbers and we would always be less than equal to minimum of

01:21.790 --> 01:22.570
the two numbers.

01:22.900 --> 01:23.200
OK.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.040
It would always be less than equal to a minimum of two numbers.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.870
So, for example, is it and B is 12?

01:32.430 --> 01:37.670
You cannot have a number that is greater than the smaller number that will divide both, OK?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.390
So you cannot say I will have a number 10 that will also divide it.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.770
No, this is not possible.

01:43.250 --> 01:50.540
The decree would always be less than or equal to the minimum of two numbers and the minimum value of

01:51.170 --> 01:53.780
a number that can divide both the numbers would be one.

01:54.380 --> 02:00.950
So we can say that the DCD would lie in the range.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.170
Think from one to the minimum of.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.420
A common be, OK?

02:10.140 --> 02:15.090
This would be the end so that we know that our answer would always lie in this range.

02:15.570 --> 02:20.880
OK, so we are trying to build a very brute force logic for computing logically.

02:21.270 --> 02:27.980
Again, we are going to try out all possibilities what numbers can be a desired offer given them, but.

02:29.090 --> 02:34.970
To this, we know, and if we know this, we can easily I dread over the strange using the loop.

02:35.570 --> 02:41.990
And now we want to find out the greatest number in this range, which divides what end.

02:42.710 --> 02:46.040
So let us see how we will build this particular algorithm.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.470
Let's dig an example, let's say.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.380
Is it?

02:52.390 --> 03:00.010
And let it be is Wendy makes it to what is minimum of a.

03:00.850 --> 03:04.090
It is, of course, it will outrage over the range.

03:04.510 --> 03:11.140
One two three four five six seven eight.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.680
In the beginning, we attract one.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.920
Does one divide A and B none.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.580
Three Yes.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.540
And we will have we will update our decision.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.500
OK, so what is the largest number we have seen that divides both?

03:26.920 --> 03:28.920
That number is nothing but one.

03:30.330 --> 03:34.950
We go to do those to divide and us to divide be the answer is yes.

03:35.550 --> 03:41.660
So we will update our DCD studios to those three divide, but it does not divide it.

03:41.670 --> 03:45.450
It does not divide 20 does four divide eight and 20?

03:45.670 --> 03:50.580
Yes, it divides the four divides eight and four divides 20.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.050
So hence the decision is for now we go to five.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.270
Does not divide, does not divide.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.080
We go to six.

03:58.890 --> 03:59.760
Does not divide.

03:59.970 --> 04:00.840
Does not divide.

04:01.200 --> 04:01.980
We go to seven.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.030
Does not divide.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.440
Does not divide.

04:05.040 --> 04:05.760
We go to eight.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.410
It divides eight.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.540
But it does not divide 20.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.640
OK, so that means.

04:13.190 --> 04:16.020
And what would be the value of these hidden all these iterations?

04:16.040 --> 04:19.340
We have not updated the value of decision in all of these arbitrations.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.550
Finally, the DCD would be nothing but forward.

04:22.970 --> 04:25.260
OK, the decision would be same.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.130
That would be for.

04:26.990 --> 04:33.230
So we've found all three numbers one, two and four that divides, what, 18 20.

04:33.410 --> 04:40.880
Hence the largest number as forward and hence the decision is for now, take a pause and think, can

04:40.880 --> 04:43.610
you come up with a flowchart to solve this problem?

04:43.760 --> 04:47.330
OK, now let us discuss the solution.

04:48.290 --> 04:51.410
Let's solve using a flowchart.

04:52.010 --> 04:53.330
The first step would be start.

04:54.740 --> 05:01.280
As usual, then it would be read they're doing numbers that is read and be.

05:03.680 --> 05:11.020
And now what we are going to do, we are going to initialize what we are doing to initialize led to

05:11.120 --> 05:13.640
AI that is equal to one.

05:15.210 --> 05:24.210
And we're going to go to a minimum of envy, so if I is less than equal to a minimum of a comma B.

05:26.160 --> 05:26.490
OK.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.330
If it does, yes.

05:30.510 --> 05:33.150
So what we are going to do is we are going to check.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.500
If I divides and divides me also, so we are again going to put our decision box here.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.780
Is a divisible by.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.820
And be divisible by.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.390
If the answer is yes, OK?

05:55.640 --> 05:56.810
Then what we are going to do.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.250
We are going to update our DVD.

06:00.310 --> 06:06.520
We are going to say that what do you see is equal, do I because I is the largest number so far we have

06:06.520 --> 06:09.330
seen that divides both NBA?

06:10.510 --> 06:17.110
That divides both N.B., so we have to complete this brand of norm, and we have to complete this brand

06:17.120 --> 06:17.800
of noise with.

06:19.410 --> 06:23.700
So after updating this will do we will go to the next day.

06:24.420 --> 06:27.960
That is I will do I +1.

06:28.620 --> 06:36.580
And even if I does not divide and we would, then also we will go to the snakes branch and we will say,

06:36.580 --> 06:36.870
OK.

06:37.940 --> 06:38.870
I was, too.

06:40.190 --> 06:40.880
A-plus.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.300
What?

06:42.520 --> 06:46.600
And from here, we are again going to connect bucket.

06:47.990 --> 06:53.660
We are again going to connect bank it, so if we come out of the loop, that means we have explored

06:53.660 --> 06:54.440
all options.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.120
What we are going to do.

06:56.300 --> 07:01.220
We are going to bring the value of diversity so we can bring.

07:02.300 --> 07:07.310
The do you study the greatest common divisor, and that's it.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.210
Not X-rated.

07:10.160 --> 07:10.450
OK.

07:11.250 --> 07:11.810
We are done.

07:14.710 --> 07:18.300
Now, let us try to brighten this cold for, let's say.

07:19.930 --> 07:20.890
Six on foot.

07:21.550 --> 07:21.850
OK.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.800
It's a six and B is.

07:26.510 --> 07:30.020
Later, this is what end is will run this code from one to four.

07:30.800 --> 07:40.370
OK, so when I choose, one is one less than minimum of N.B., so minimum of India's vote, so is four

07:40.400 --> 07:41.540
divisible by one.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.760
Is six divisible by one, yes, is Florida eligible were one, yes.

07:47.270 --> 07:47.940
So what we do?

07:47.990 --> 07:50.090
Do you think we're the ones over these three days?

07:50.090 --> 07:50.390
One?

07:51.680 --> 07:52.090
Great.

07:52.190 --> 07:56.480
We go to makes no I equal I plus one, I becomes too.

07:57.730 --> 08:01.540
Is six divisible by one for divisible by 200?

08:01.570 --> 08:05.470
Yes, we are going to go ahead and we update a verdict.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.360
Do you see this?

08:06.370 --> 08:08.350
Do we go to three?

08:09.840 --> 08:14.820
The next number that is three is six divisible by three, yes, is four divisible.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.010
No, we do not update our duty.

08:17.550 --> 08:21.300
We simply take this route and go to the next number.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.900
We go to four is six divisible by four.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.280
No is four divisible by four.

08:26.290 --> 08:26.700
Yes.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.770
So we don't update our destiny.

08:29.370 --> 08:30.890
So this really remains same.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.620
That is true.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.920
So finally, we make is five.

08:36.230 --> 08:42.410
And five is not less than equal to minimum of envy, so what we do, we come out of this loop, we bring

08:42.410 --> 08:44.360
the GST and then we exit.

08:45.110 --> 08:45.710
That's all.

08:45.740 --> 08:53.420
That is how we have computed the OECD using a very basic solution, OK, data optimized algorithms to

08:53.420 --> 08:53.840
do it.

08:55.010 --> 09:00.460
That is a Euclid's algorithm, but that would be that would not be covered yet.

09:00.680 --> 09:06.530
It's slightly advanced algorithm, and this is the most basic way of computing the DCT.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.520
That's all for this video.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.050
Thank you.
