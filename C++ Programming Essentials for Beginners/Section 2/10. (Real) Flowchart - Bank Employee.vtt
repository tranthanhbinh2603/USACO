00:01.430 --> 00:05.090
Everyone in this lecture will discuss the real world example of flowchart.

00:05.210 --> 00:05.500
OK.

00:05.720 --> 00:12.650
Just to make of it in this tiny little mode better the question as a bank is open till six pm and the

00:12.650 --> 00:16.850
banker needs to process requests from the customers, OK?

00:17.530 --> 00:24.200
The requests can be of one of the four types Guy's deposit, cash withdrawal, check deposit and making

00:24.200 --> 00:24.980
or demand draft.

00:25.550 --> 00:28.160
We want to draw the flowchart of a bank employee.

00:29.060 --> 00:36.410
Now, the bank employee can process one of these requests, but we also need to see that the customer

00:36.410 --> 00:38.130
can enter the bank if it is open.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.880
So let us see how the flowchart would look like.

00:41.750 --> 00:47.630
So if you want, you can spend two minutes to think and try to come up with a solution of your own.

00:48.170 --> 00:52.520
Otherwise, we had the solution and we will discuss this solution with you, OK?

00:53.390 --> 00:57.250
So the flowchart will start from the first step.

00:57.260 --> 01:01.810
The bank gets open in the morning and in front of bank.

01:01.820 --> 01:06.200
There is a queue and the if.

01:06.440 --> 01:14.540
If the queue is empty, OK, and time is greater than six p.m., then we will close the bank.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.880
Otherwise, what we will do, we will try to extract customers from the queue.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.150
OK?

01:20.630 --> 01:29.600
So if there are people which are standing in the queue, we will try to extract the customers OK from

01:29.600 --> 01:29.990
the queue.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.330
Now, if the bank is open.

01:32.620 --> 01:40.970
So suppose you come here and the bank is open and there can be two possibilities either the queue is

01:40.970 --> 01:43.090
empty on the queue is not empty.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.510
That means during the time that the bank is open.

01:45.530 --> 01:48.680
OK, so we are coming here when time is less than six.

01:49.520 --> 01:56.090
And now if the queue is empty, then we will again go and check whether there are certain people that

01:56.090 --> 01:57.320
have entered the queue or not.

01:58.070 --> 02:02.840
If it is not the case, then we will extract a customer from the queue.

02:03.590 --> 02:08.270
So in the later on, when you will learn some more concepts about programming, you will learn about

02:08.270 --> 02:10.210
data centers, OK?

02:10.850 --> 02:14.240
The researchers are nothing, but they are the containers that store data.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.860
So you is actually your data sector.

02:15.860 --> 02:22.410
So we are performing an operation that if the queue is empty or not, if there is a person here, if

02:22.430 --> 02:28.850
there is a person here that is a person, it these people, ABC, they are waiting in the queue to get

02:28.850 --> 02:34.880
their work done and the bank will remove the ghost mode, which is dead at the front of the queue.

02:35.540 --> 02:39.100
Our next step would be to read the request of this person.

02:39.110 --> 02:42.290
We will ask this person, What do you want to do?

02:42.740 --> 02:45.710
That is denoted using this box read request.

02:46.670 --> 02:52.580
Now, once you have read the request, you have to make a decision which content this person will give.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.970
So there are, let's say, four different counters.

02:56.060 --> 03:00.830
One as A1 is B, one is C, one is D, which processed these requests.

03:00.830 --> 03:05.240
OK, so first we will check is this request for a demand draft?

03:05.360 --> 03:08.360
If we did, yes, we send this customer to country.

03:08.660 --> 03:11.900
If it is not, we check if it is a request for direct deposit.

03:12.170 --> 03:19.160
If yes, we send this person to counter, we if not, we send this person to counter-sued and we check

03:19.160 --> 03:21.070
if it is for cash withdrawal.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.700
If yes, we send this to counter C, otherwise we take it for this guy's deposit.

03:25.700 --> 03:26.990
We send it to we.

03:26.990 --> 03:31.870
If it is something else, OK, so maybe we have a miscellaneous helpline Gonder.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.310
So we send this person to that country.

03:34.310 --> 03:39.620
OK, this is how the various requests of these persons would be processed.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.490
Now you may have separate flowchart for each of these actions.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.860
OK, so maybe there could be a flowchart starting from me.

03:48.860 --> 03:53.200
OK, this is how you process the demand graph.

03:53.210 --> 04:03.920
So humans OK, it is a flowchart read demand draft OK, and there may be some process to create a demand

04:03.920 --> 04:04.220
draft.

04:04.220 --> 04:05.360
OK, or something like that.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.610
Credit or debit demand, whatever you want to do, and then maybe end or hand it over to the customer,

04:11.630 --> 04:12.560
whatever it could be.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.120
So there can be separate flowchart for a busy, endless what you can do.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.590
So sometimes in a problem, the flowchart can get quite big.

04:21.680 --> 04:29.930
So in that case, you be the other part of the flowchart like we are doing in this case, starting from

04:29.930 --> 04:31.340
E, it'll be exit.

04:31.670 --> 04:34.670
OK, well, we exit all, be connected to some other point.

04:36.430 --> 04:42.160
So what we are doing is we're making these circles, so these circles are known as connectors.

04:42.440 --> 04:47.110
Look, they are known as the nucleus, so they're combining two different products.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.210
And there can be separate flowchart for ABC, and so.

04:52.680 --> 05:01.870
But now we have to understand that this would be a high level overview of our flowchart for a bank employee,

05:01.870 --> 05:06.420
it would look like, OK, it's a bank employee would wait for customers in the queue that you would

05:06.420 --> 05:09.270
be dead if the bank is open.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.320
And for that, that is certain time.

05:12.190 --> 05:16.260
And yes, that's how a flowchart would look like.

05:16.830 --> 05:20.910
I hope you understood this flowchart on that side for this video.
