00:00.870 --> 00:06.750
Everyone's in this we do have to talk about certain course logistics and how do you should how you should

00:06.750 --> 00:07.950
proceed with this course.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.210
So let us talk about what are the things that the scores on this court has multiple sections on each

00:15.210 --> 00:22.110
section has multiple concept videos, so they can be either a theory concept or they can be accordingly

00:22.110 --> 00:25.680
do where I show you my coding in real.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.490
How does a particular code is written or how does it work?

00:28.500 --> 00:31.350
Or so we do real coding hands on coding in this section.

00:32.190 --> 00:38.850
And then there is also a code repository which contains all the codes which we discuss in this course.

00:39.630 --> 00:46.380
There is a U.S. which you can use to ask Dowds from teaching assistants of the scores on what he is

00:46.470 --> 00:50.700
doing to monitor doubts on daily basis, and they're going to help you with their doubts.

00:51.540 --> 00:57.780
It is a Discord server where you can interact with other peer learners who are doing with this course

00:58.200 --> 01:00.750
and you can have discussions on any topic.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.810
And there is a feature to make notes, so I don't provide any notes.

01:05.820 --> 01:11.220
So I suggest you make your own notes after topics that you think you're likely to forget.

01:11.220 --> 01:11.460
OK?

01:11.740 --> 01:18.260
So either they can be handed a note or you can use the Udemy feature to say what electronic note or

01:18.260 --> 01:23.740
a digital note for you so that you can use that note later, OK?

01:23.760 --> 01:27.640
So it's totally up to you at what point you want to make a note, right?

01:28.290 --> 01:34.590
And then there practice coding questions which are very important, and each section contains multiple

01:34.590 --> 01:40.080
questions so that once you solve that problem, you get confidence to apply the skills that you have

01:40.080 --> 01:40.410
learned.

01:41.310 --> 01:46.320
There are also multiple choice questions which are in the form of quizzes in this course, and they

01:46.320 --> 01:51.980
will test your understanding of the concepts that have been taught in a particular section, right?

01:52.590 --> 01:57.390
So you should watch videos, you should make notes and you should try out the assignment.

01:57.390 --> 01:59.280
That is the flow I would recommend you to follow.

02:00.060 --> 02:06.270
And as a beginner right now, you don't need to jump to any other platform unless you complete this

02:06.270 --> 02:06.600
course.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.030
That is my recommendation again.

02:09.750 --> 02:15.570
And there is an online I wrote coding when I com, which you can use as per your convenience.

02:15.570 --> 02:22.500
If you want don't want to set up an off line idea or if you are having some issues working with an idea

02:22.500 --> 02:24.420
in the beginning, you can use in any online.

02:24.420 --> 02:31.770
Writing on this course is short and dark mode so that when you are studying at night, you don't you

02:31.890 --> 02:33.110
eyes feel comfortable.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.400
OK, so generally black does not.

02:37.410 --> 02:42.000
Puts too much strain on this, it's more easy to read on a black screen as compared to white.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.000
And so that is why we went with the dark mode.

02:45.570 --> 02:49.380
And yet that's all for this course and I will see you in the next section.
