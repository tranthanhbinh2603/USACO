00:01.020 --> 00:07.810
And welcome to this course on C++ essentials, and I'm very excited to welcome you on congratulations

00:07.810 --> 00:10.750
on taking the first step into the world of programming.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.550
So my name is pretty.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.890
I've been a software engineer at Google.

00:14.890 --> 00:18.730
I have co-founded two tech startups, including coding minutes.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.280
I work with scalar academy as well.

00:21.580 --> 00:25.300
And I've been instructor on Udemy for about one year now.

00:25.870 --> 00:31.910
And if you want to learn more about me, so I created an interactive portfolio resumÃ© website on that

00:31.930 --> 00:38.200
igniting dot com, which you can visit and look at my journey of learning coding.

00:38.350 --> 00:40.420
When did I start and what did I achieve?

00:41.970 --> 00:48.000
So before we dive into the specific details, I would like to share my perspective on learning to code

00:48.000 --> 00:49.680
on becoming a problem solver.

00:50.430 --> 00:58.050
What we do is I break down the step into three parts, like the first step of learning programming is

00:58.050 --> 00:59.280
learning to hold the knife.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.350
What does it mean?

01:00.470 --> 01:06.600
Get them translated with a real world analogy so that if you're a beginner, you understand the flaw

01:06.630 --> 01:07.800
in a better sense, right?

01:08.430 --> 01:12.030
The first step is always to learn to work with the programming language.

01:12.060 --> 01:18.030
So programming language is our tool and will try to get comfortable with the programming language in

01:18.030 --> 01:18.660
this course.

01:19.480 --> 01:25.080
Once you're comfortable, the next step is you learn to use the knife by cutting a fruit.

01:25.560 --> 01:31.320
It means you learn how to solve a problem and what solving problems you need something.

01:31.350 --> 01:37.920
Already the researchers, which are basically the containers that you need to store data on, you need

01:37.920 --> 01:41.850
to learn algorithms which are basically their techniques to solve the problem, OK?

01:42.630 --> 01:46.530
So then in the next step, you will learn about data centers an algorithm.

01:46.980 --> 01:52.110
And the third step is, once you have learned to work with the researchers algorithms, you have to

01:52.110 --> 01:55.140
apply them to newer kind of problems.

01:55.140 --> 02:00.000
OK, so this is what is also observed in many interviews.

02:00.030 --> 02:05.040
So you would be given a problem statement, which would be a newer, unseen problem, and it can be

02:05.040 --> 02:06.720
a problem inspired from real world.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.290
For example, you want to find the nearest hospital, or maybe you want to devise a route for the cab,

02:13.770 --> 02:17.640
which works in a sharing model, something like that.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.130
So the third step is about sharpening your knife and you have to cut your kind of route.

02:23.190 --> 02:26.940
So that is one step ahead of these three steps.

02:27.300 --> 02:34.320
I have created a problem solving track, and this is the first course of the track where you get comfortable

02:34.320 --> 02:38.010
with the programming language in the next course, which is on data centers.

02:38.910 --> 02:43.770
You learn how to work with different containers and their time complexities as well.

02:44.220 --> 02:49.590
And in the third step, you learn how to sharpen your skills, how do you sharpen your knife and applied

02:49.590 --> 02:52.830
algorithmic techniques to different type of problems, OK?

02:53.340 --> 03:01.170
And so that's why I have devised three courses so that you go from zero to hero in in your journey of

03:01.170 --> 03:02.070
solving problems.

03:02.490 --> 03:08.490
I will be there in all three courses to help you the must become the master of problem solving.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.180
And yeah, that is the problem solving track for you.

03:12.930 --> 03:18.480
So before we discuss about this course, let me also tell you a little bit more about my professional

03:18.480 --> 03:19.050
experience.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.080
I've created several top rated online courses on did great coding minutes to bring high quality courses

03:25.080 --> 03:25.650
on Udemy.

03:26.220 --> 03:31.440
And a lot of my students who have gone through this journey of problem solving with me.

03:31.800 --> 03:37.500
They're working in top product companies, including startups and companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft

03:37.500 --> 03:38.100
as well, right?

03:39.540 --> 03:41.450
So what to expect after this course?

03:41.490 --> 03:46.890
So I'm just going to talk about this course, so you'll get comfortable with the programming language.

03:46.890 --> 03:50.940
It does not matter which programming language you start with, it can be C++.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.500
It can be deployed, can be Python.

03:53.070 --> 04:00.840
But for this course, I've picked C++ as the language, and it helps you to get into more details of

04:01.440 --> 04:05.760
how the programs work, what happens at the binary level and all that stuff.

04:05.760 --> 04:12.210
We do go in this course and you build solid programming foundations annually, radiological thinking

04:12.210 --> 04:14.640
skills which are required to take the next step.

04:15.570 --> 04:20.850
And you'll get familiar with concepts like loops, branching is string through cohesion, back dragging

04:20.850 --> 04:24.150
on with masking and loops will cover these.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.890
You can have a detailed look at the curriculum, right?

04:27.240 --> 04:32.340
The first part is the logic building curriculum, which is again optional if you're already familiar

04:32.340 --> 04:33.210
with logic building.

04:33.750 --> 04:34.800
So I discuss.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.710
Few things before you start writing good.

04:38.070 --> 04:43.260
I discuss floor jokes and go dark, tell you how to think like a programmer given a small problem.

04:43.830 --> 04:46.910
How do we break it down and how do we build logic for the same?

04:47.550 --> 04:53.850
The second part of the course is more C++ specific, and we try to learn with various language constructs,

04:53.850 --> 05:02.310
like how to write code that is using effects, ranging concepts, loops, operators, functions, pointers

05:02.310 --> 05:09.810
et is Gutierrez Strings recursion and basics of object oriented programming so that the complete curriculum

05:09.810 --> 05:17.460
of this course and um, and you know the good thing, there are no prerequisites to take this course.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.560
So if you are an absolute beginner and if you have not worked with programming anywhere in your life,

05:23.040 --> 05:24.090
you are at the right point.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.150
This is the right step to start learning programming, right?

05:27.810 --> 05:34.260
And so I hope you are ready to join me on this journey of learning coding and you will tighten your

05:34.530 --> 05:36.450
seat belt and I will see you in the course.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.280
Thank you.

05:37.290 --> 05:37.710
Bye bye.
