Hello, everyone.

00:01.860 --> 00:06.730
So till now, we have been writing programs on in some of the programs, you might have seen that I've

00:06.730 --> 00:09.010
written something that starts from the last.

00:09.820 --> 00:11.920
This thing is actually known as a comment.

00:12.160 --> 00:18.280
OK, so what is a common comment is just a piece of text that is ignored by the compiler.

00:18.940 --> 00:20.380
It is basically to tell.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.060
It's basically to annotate what your code is doing.

00:24.070 --> 00:28.990
Or we can use this command to explain something inside the code.

00:28.990 --> 00:35.260
OK, so it's just a piece of text that is used to enter the code, and it is ignored by the compiler

00:35.260 --> 00:38.710
because this is not executed by the compiler.

00:38.740 --> 00:43.660
And we can also use comments to make certain lines of the code inactive.

00:43.660 --> 00:49.210
For example, I don't want to take input that I want to make this part inactive.

00:49.870 --> 00:52.240
I can command out this particular line.

00:52.810 --> 00:57.420
We can also command out multiple lines by defining a comment like this.

00:57.430 --> 00:57.700
OK?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.130
So this is known as a multi line comment.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.000
So if you start from the baseline.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.040
So this creates a single line comment.

01:06.520 --> 01:06.790
OK.

01:07.070 --> 01:10.390
Anything that is written below will not be a comment.

01:10.690 --> 01:17.470
So this is an example of a multi line comment that I'm trying to show you is here.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.020
So, for example, I want to comment this part out.

01:20.650 --> 01:23.720
So I will start with backslash start.

01:24.370 --> 01:27.670
I will write the comment and I will end with Star Backslash.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.010
So this creates a Maryland comment.

01:30.010 --> 01:34.480
So these are two type two ways of commenting your code in C++.

01:34.900 --> 01:39.540
So we have seen that we can write a single line automatically line comment in a C++ program.

01:39.550 --> 01:40.900
So that's all for this video.

01:40.930 --> 01:41.410
Thank you.
