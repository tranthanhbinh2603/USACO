00:02.800 --> 00:08.470
I in this lecture will talk about keywords, which is quite an important concept when it comes to learning

00:08.470 --> 00:09.580
a programming language.

00:10.270 --> 00:17.320
Every language has keywords on whether keywords, so keywords, special words that have a special meaning

00:17.320 --> 00:18.490
for the compiler will get.

00:18.820 --> 00:21.190
That means they are kind of resolved.

00:21.250 --> 00:28.300
You cannot use these names for any other purpose, like you cannot use these keywords for giving a name

00:28.300 --> 00:30.820
to a function or giving a name to a variable.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.080
You cannot use them, OK.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.260
These keywords cannot be used as identified.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.570
That is what you need to know on C++ as 95 reserved words.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.030
So you do not need to memorize how many keywords are there or what all those keywords.

00:46.720 --> 00:53.470
But I will give you a quick look of what kind of words in a programming language like C and C++.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.290
You will find and we can call them as keyword tool kit.

00:56.950 --> 01:05.200
For example, a word like LS, you will use it very frequently word like long, which is kind of a data

01:05.200 --> 01:05.500
type.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.190
It's like double auto brake.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.670
God, Gonzales Lord.

01:13.210 --> 01:13.860
Continue.

01:14.260 --> 01:14.530
OK.

01:15.070 --> 01:19.960
So we are going to see a lot of them while we are going to write code, OK?

01:20.590 --> 01:23.620
All these are examples of keywords, right?

01:24.400 --> 01:30.730
And there are 32 keywords which are both common in C and D Plus Plus, and there are some new keywords

01:30.730 --> 01:33.430
which were introduced in C++, for example.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.950
A keyword is a namespace is a keyword.

01:36.580 --> 01:40.030
Rent is a world class, is a keyword.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.330
The glass is used in object oriented programming.

01:43.810 --> 01:53.010
D is not an object oriented language, but C++, as C++ has the keyword called class and that is true.

01:53.020 --> 02:00.280
Falls and type name public private operator OK.

02:00.970 --> 02:07.120
A lot of lot of keywords you can see are dead and you cannot use these keywords.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.760
Giving a name to a particular variable look.

02:13.330 --> 02:21.400
So if we go to this particular code and what we want to identify what all key words this code is using.

02:22.440 --> 02:28.500
So if you look at from the previous example that ended up given in the very beginning and discovered

02:29.160 --> 02:37.200
this in dissolve turkey, but if it also achieved OK, this is achieved, this far is achieved, this

02:37.200 --> 02:38.310
it had done is achieved.

02:38.640 --> 02:38.870
OK.

02:40.120 --> 02:40.540
And.

02:41.810 --> 02:42.050
Yeah.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.670
So you can see there are a lot of key words we are using in our particular program.

02:46.830 --> 02:47.150
OK.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.870
And we're going to see this Ford is actually a key word, right?

02:52.520 --> 02:55.040
That is what I was trying to show you here.

02:55.130 --> 02:57.650
This fight isn't even particularly vile.

02:57.650 --> 02:59.600
It'll give it these key words.

03:00.290 --> 03:01.820
Each word has a special meaning.

03:01.820 --> 03:08.050
For example, the four key word is used to create a loop and loop is used.

03:08.060 --> 03:13.790
If you want to do something again and again in every program, you will find there are certain keywords

03:14.180 --> 03:20.600
which are specific to that particular language, and many different languages can also have same keywords,

03:20.600 --> 03:21.500
for example.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.330
The fight is also given in Java.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.960
It's also keyword invite.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.620
Then it's a very commonly used keyword, right?

03:28.620 --> 03:34.830
And that's all about key words that you need to know, and in the next few days, we'll talk about the

03:34.830 --> 03:36.210
concept of mean.
