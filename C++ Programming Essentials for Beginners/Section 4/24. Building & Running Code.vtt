00:01.590 --> 00:06.930
Everyone in this lecture, we're going to write this code in our program and we are going to build it

00:06.930 --> 00:07.770
and run it.

00:08.430 --> 00:10.860
First of all, you need a few of your things.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.430
You need a text editor to write the code that you can download.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.500
So we would be using sublime text.

00:16.770 --> 00:20.370
It's very lightweight and very cool that I personally like a lot.

00:20.910 --> 00:27.390
You can go with any other options as well as per your wish on taking those you need to install a C++

00:27.390 --> 00:27.960
compiler.

00:28.050 --> 00:33.780
I will attach the links in the description, and when you're done with the two things what you need

00:33.780 --> 00:39.930
to do, you need to open up your extruder, which is which would look something like this.

00:41.020 --> 00:49.720
And you need to save your fight, look, so if I tell you I saved as file as maybe a loader CPB, OK,

00:49.720 --> 00:52.950
so or maybe hello world or TPP.

00:53.590 --> 00:55.210
This will create a new file.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.210
You can store it anywhere, any director you want.

00:58.780 --> 01:05.110
And we are going to type the same thing that we have seen in the boilerplate code, you will say, using

01:05.110 --> 01:06.850
namespace today.

01:07.540 --> 01:12.450
And after that, we are going to create the mean that is the entry point of the program.

01:12.460 --> 01:15.970
And we are also going to define the exit of the mean that is written zero.

01:16.810 --> 01:21.670
It signifies that the program has successfully terminated anything.

01:21.670 --> 01:23.230
Any good idea of right.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.030
That logic will go ahead.

01:25.660 --> 01:35.440
If you want to print something well in C++, we will use this syntax C out, followed by the value that

01:35.440 --> 01:36.130
you want to print.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.800
So maybe I want to print a very simple string.

01:39.100 --> 01:39.370
Hello.

01:39.790 --> 01:44.460
So string goes inside the barcodes, followed by end to end.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.910
It is like a new line.

01:45.910 --> 01:47.590
I want to shift to the new line.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.270
So for that, we use in here.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.450
And so these.

01:54.610 --> 02:01.930
These things are this is an operator, OK, is this is actually a left shift operator, but it it it

02:01.930 --> 02:07.870
has a special meaning for the compiler or get a compiler, understand these operators and these keywords

02:08.350 --> 02:11.710
as per the rules of the C++ programming language.

02:11.740 --> 02:17.950
So in the next set of videos, we are going to understand these rules, these new keyboards, what are

02:17.950 --> 02:18.820
water functions?

02:18.820 --> 02:20.200
What are variables?

02:20.320 --> 02:22.990
So we are going to look at everything in detail.

02:23.110 --> 02:29.320
But for now, we are just trying to show you how to write a very simple code on how you can run this

02:29.650 --> 02:30.460
on your machine.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.290
So now what happened is we have the source code.

02:35.740 --> 02:38.470
OK, we have the source code with us.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.930
So this file, this is known as source code.

02:41.750 --> 02:46.180
There is a piece of application that we have installed on this system.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.610
So that is known as a C++ compiler.

02:51.760 --> 03:02.370
We have a C++ compiler on the C++ compiler itself is a complex thing to understand what we are going

03:02.370 --> 03:03.480
to do in this lecture.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.580
We're going to see at high level what is going to happen.

03:06.090 --> 03:14.940
So it is going to accept a source file, which is a of TPP, and it is going to produce an executable

03:14.940 --> 03:15.240
file.

03:15.690 --> 03:24.840
May maybe something like Halo Dot, Eggsy if you are on a Windows machine or something like Halo out

03:25.110 --> 03:25.830
if you're on.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.230
A magic machine, something like this.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.830
What we're going to do, it will give us a file.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.430
These files can be executed.

03:35.850 --> 03:37.300
We need to run these files, OK?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.630
We need to run these files.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.420
The first step is compile the code.

03:43.650 --> 03:52.800
The compilation process will give us an executable as an end output, and we need to run that file and

03:52.800 --> 03:57.810
that will show us the output of the program, so it is a two step process.

03:57.840 --> 04:07.080
OK, so first step is building the code, which includes some violation and the second step is executing

04:07.080 --> 04:07.470
the code.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.870
That means we are going to run this code.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.900
So every program we are going to perform these two steps.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.490
I'm going to show you these steps through a command line.

04:16.500 --> 04:22.770
So what you need to do, you need to open up terminal and you need to go to the location where you are.

04:22.800 --> 04:30.570
So, for example, currently led to be at home to other quarters in the desktop world and inside CBB

04:30.570 --> 04:31.050
lecture.

04:32.700 --> 04:37.350
We come here and you do the command that we use to change that entry.

04:38.070 --> 04:44.040
And inside this directory, if I do less alert means tell me what all files do we have?

04:44.310 --> 04:49.590
OK, so it creates it has a file called Hello World Dog CBB.

04:50.460 --> 04:50.760
OK.

04:51.090 --> 04:56.070
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to build this code and show you the output.

04:58.450 --> 05:02.530
So let us see how to use the C++ compiler, OK?

05:03.130 --> 05:06.550
So there is a command that is known as D-plus Plus.

05:06.950 --> 05:13.390
So you hit the D-plus Plus is a command that invokes the Jianyu C++ compiler.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.240
Jianyu C++ compiler.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.880
This compiler gets invoked.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.080
And this needs to be installed on your machine.

05:22.570 --> 05:28.470
This this piece of software gets invoked when you write this command deeply if you want to see what

05:28.470 --> 05:30.210
version of Duplicitous, I'm using.

05:31.260 --> 05:38.280
You can see this is these are the details of the compiled ways and you get so you can see this version

05:38.280 --> 05:39.810
is twelve point zero and so on.

05:40.210 --> 05:47.910
And this is for this particular hardware that my machine has been being you using, OK?

05:48.600 --> 05:54.090
So you can install any version that maybe is the latest version of the previous version.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.080
Totally up to you.

05:55.560 --> 06:03.630
So what we are doing, we are going to use D-plus Plus to give our source file and create a executable

06:03.630 --> 06:03.870
file.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.290
So I'm going to say and C++, Hello world.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.860
DOD CPB.

06:10.790 --> 06:16.320
Now what happens this command executed successfully, and if I a list now?

06:16.760 --> 06:18.590
There is a file called 8Ot out.

06:19.130 --> 06:24.110
This is the default name of the file that has been created by our compiler.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.760
And if I want to run this file, I have to say dodged like it or not.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.760
This is how I compiled the file.

06:32.600 --> 06:39.320
So this step is, is the compilation think that this is, uh, compile?

06:40.600 --> 06:49.090
And this step is actually about executions, the law and order underscored again and underscored here,

06:49.510 --> 06:52.570
if I press and enter now, you can see the output.

06:52.810 --> 06:53.390
Hello, world.

06:53.980 --> 07:01.330
I suppose I want to change my code and instead of saying hello world, I want to say hello everyone.

07:02.230 --> 07:07.510
So what I will do, I will go back to my it and I will look.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.710
Hello, everyone.

07:09.910 --> 07:17.590
And again, back to the terminal, if I again run this good, I will not see any change because I have

07:17.590 --> 07:26.590
not completed the compilation converts your source code into machine good orders, resin in the executable

07:26.590 --> 07:28.570
file and that is run by the machine.

07:28.630 --> 07:33.360
So what we need to do if we want to reflect the new output, we have to build our code again.

07:33.370 --> 07:40.740
So we'll see D-plus Plus Hello World Dot A.P.B and laser dot like a dot.

07:40.810 --> 07:44.970
OK, so now you can see the output is a lovely one.

07:45.310 --> 07:45.580
OK.

07:45.970 --> 07:49.600
And this is going to run your code on.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.490
You see the output that has been updated as opposed.

07:53.500 --> 08:01.060
If you want to rename your output file, you don't want the output file to look like you wrote out you

08:01.060 --> 08:01.930
want something else.

08:02.560 --> 08:09.760
So in that case, this d-plus plus except certain flags, so you can still get the name of the output

08:09.760 --> 08:10.130
file.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.180
It should be something else.

08:12.190 --> 08:16.060
It should be hollowed out out instead of or maybe.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.160
Hello, everyone got out.

08:20.140 --> 08:21.790
And I'm going to compile the file.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.850
Hello, World Dot CPB.

08:25.340 --> 08:31.640
I'm going to compile the file Helloworld or TPP, not if I do it less.

08:32.270 --> 08:33.230
What are you going to hit?

08:33.740 --> 08:35.780
There is a file that has been created.

08:36.470 --> 08:37.490
Everyone thought out.

08:38.120 --> 08:43.250
So what we have said that the name of the executable file, it should not be rolled out.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.390
It should be.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.710
Hello, everyone.

08:45.710 --> 08:48.140
No doubt we have specified.

08:50.600 --> 08:57.470
A flag, and we are telling that again, the output should be this one, and it should not be the default

08:57.470 --> 08:58.970
one, which is not or.

08:59.270 --> 09:02.720
And here it is our source file.

09:03.380 --> 09:08.870
And with this flag, we have defined what should be the value of it.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.730
Output file.

09:10.820 --> 09:15.930
So in this case, if you want to run discord now, you will not be using large, large adulthood.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.750
You should be using torchlight.

09:18.740 --> 09:19.610
Hello, everyone.

09:20.180 --> 09:20.840
Dot Dot.

09:21.490 --> 09:23.060
OK, now you see the output.

09:23.180 --> 09:23.810
Hello, everyone.

09:24.440 --> 09:30.350
That is a slight introduction to how do you build and run a code using a C++ compiler?

09:30.860 --> 09:36.590
And I hope you clearly understood these steps, and the compilation itself is a complex thing.

09:36.800 --> 09:42.110
So we will spend one with you on diving deep into the details of the compilation process.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.790
That's all for this video.

09:43.820 --> 09:44.330
Thank you.
