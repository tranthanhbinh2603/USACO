00:01.810 --> 00:07.720
I so now we will solve this pyramid pardon problem, so we have to print this kind of a burden for a

00:07.720 --> 00:08.070
given.

00:08.190 --> 00:10.330
And so in this burden, we have three rows.

00:11.020 --> 00:15.870
And as you can see in each row, there are some spaces followed by some started OK.

00:16.330 --> 00:18.760
So first of all, I will write the observations.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.430
So the observation is there are Andrews.

00:24.180 --> 00:24.480
OK.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.770
And in each row, there are some spaces.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.920
How in this business that we will figure it out?

00:34.060 --> 00:39.340
Followed by some number of stops, OK, followed by some number of stunts.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.030
We have to generalize this for any.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.180
I threw.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.970
So let us see what happened in this president.

00:49.790 --> 00:54.380
If you look carefully that there are those places it.

00:55.650 --> 01:01.140
OK, and they're the ones buried under zeros, basically zero, because we've right the number of spaces

01:01.800 --> 01:05.790
in the air through two spaces, one space, zero space.

01:05.880 --> 01:13.710
So as we are going down, as the value of I is increasing, OK, the number of spaces is decreasing.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.480
We can see as one is two and three.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.070
That is the rule number two.

01:20.070 --> 01:20.880
Can you relate?

01:21.570 --> 01:24.810
Can you generalize how many spaces are there in our group?

01:25.470 --> 01:33.360
Clearly, we can see that this is nothing but three minus two to the three minus one.

01:33.870 --> 01:36.960
That is, we have two spaces, OK?

01:37.620 --> 01:41.520
In the second row, we have three minus the rule number.

01:42.210 --> 01:45.600
We have one space in the third row, we have three minus three.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.370
That is zeros.

01:47.410 --> 01:51.090
But clearly we can get these spaces by doing.

01:52.280 --> 02:00.830
And miners say in the Dietro era and miners ice business, this we figured out through our observation

02:01.460 --> 02:04.490
the better and miners ice bases in the hydro.

02:05.380 --> 02:12.970
Now, let us talk about the number of stars, how many stars we have one star, three stars and five

02:12.970 --> 02:13.480
stars.

02:14.290 --> 02:16.480
Let's figure out the formula for stars.

02:17.110 --> 02:20.470
One Star Resort and five stars.

02:20.870 --> 02:21.190
OK.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.390
Now, let's see how we can generalize this one.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.960
So the role no doubt, is a.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.870
That is nothing but one, two and three.

02:34.500 --> 02:40.530
So if you look carefully in the first rule, one starts, they wrote three star third Rule five stars

02:41.190 --> 02:42.300
by observation.

02:42.480 --> 02:49.020
I considered in in the intro that there is doing to a minus one stars because this value is nothing

02:49.020 --> 02:50.910
but two into one minus one.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.440
This is nothing but two into the minus one that is three.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.860
This is doing two three minus one.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.560
So yes, we are able to generalize the number of stars.

02:59.580 --> 02:59.820
OK.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.400
So again, this is through observation.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.030
OK.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.650
If you don't want to observe if you want to use a predefined formula.

03:08.580 --> 03:16.230
So what happens is that the number of stars, the former sequence of the type, which is known as automatic

03:16.230 --> 03:19.620
progression in a bizarre sequence.

03:20.790 --> 03:24.470
Split the difference between two consecutive terms is consent.

03:24.880 --> 03:30.780
So this is common difference, which is to this is common difference that just this different is constant

03:30.780 --> 03:32.610
across all their terms.

03:32.940 --> 03:42.270
So if you want to find out the item of this AP, there is a formula which is a plus a minus one in duty.

03:42.750 --> 03:47.650
So what is it is the first dump b the difference between two consecutive terms.

03:47.730 --> 03:48.420
So what is it?

03:49.000 --> 03:56.460
Is one is A and B is due so you can do one plus do a minus two.

03:57.480 --> 04:04.140
It does alter the way mine is, either you use the AP formula or you can use the observation, what

04:04.230 --> 04:05.700
are going to give you the same result?

04:06.180 --> 04:10.050
And hence we can see that there are two into a minus one stars.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.820
In the eye.

04:14.060 --> 04:19.130
OK, now we we have seen how to break down this pattern.

04:19.450 --> 04:19.730
OK?

04:20.210 --> 04:24.500
And after printing to a minus one size, I will also print a new line.

04:26.990 --> 04:31.590
So now you can write the pseudocode for this problem, so that is very easy.

04:31.670 --> 04:36.890
So first, we will read how many doors we have, then we will need a loop.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.560
Why did our those first Rosekind again?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.010
So let's say we are starting from the first rule.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.410
We will go till the end that rule.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.850
What we will do, we need you.

04:48.490 --> 04:49.840
We will do three things.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.060
First, we will print faces.

04:52.810 --> 04:56.890
Let's face it is one how many spaces and minors spaces?

04:57.610 --> 05:00.550
Wild spaces is less than equal to and minus.

05:01.180 --> 05:07.900
What we will do will print a space and we will implement the ground of spaces that has been printed

05:08.020 --> 05:08.650
by one.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.250
That's it.

05:09.790 --> 05:13.030
The next thing that we have to do is doing do a minus one start.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.590
So let us print us.

05:15.250 --> 05:20.830
Let's say the ground started this one wireless dodgers less than equal to two and do a minus one.

05:21.100 --> 05:27.430
What we will do will print a style and will increment the count of stars by one.

05:28.570 --> 05:36.490
The article to plus one gadget, followed by a new line, so we will talk it will print a new line.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.670
And we will go to the next drill by doing a call like this one.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.240
That's it.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.940
That completes our zero vote.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.320
And here we can write exit.

05:46.760 --> 05:54.050
Now you can see this is how we have broken down our logic into smaller components.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.410
This loop is responsible for borrowers.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.810
And the inner parts responsible for.

06:02.050 --> 06:02.800
Some part of the.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.980
So this part is responsible for spaces in each row.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.040
This is responsible for stars they need to do.

06:09.730 --> 06:13.600
This is responsible for shifting the cursor to the new line.

06:13.780 --> 06:16.180
And this I called my plus one maintains.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.370
It is a great condition for the out-of-date book.

06:22.520 --> 06:22.930
So.

06:24.660 --> 06:30.420
This is how we can afford this burden now as a homework, you can write in this pardon on your own.

06:31.080 --> 06:39.190
But I do write in this for and value and equal look forward and try to see what pattern do you get?

06:39.210 --> 06:41.520
OK, so that's all for this video.

06:41.550 --> 06:42.060
Thank you.
