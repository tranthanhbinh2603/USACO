00:01.290 --> 00:06.490
I would want in this lecture and find out the sum of numbers from one twin, I will write to Pseudocode.

00:06.600 --> 00:06.900
OK.

00:07.470 --> 00:14.610
So in the flowchart, the first step was to read and then we discussed what we need to maintain.

00:15.660 --> 00:18.150
What is the no, OK, so what is the current number?

00:18.150 --> 00:23.550
So we'll start from Michael to one, then we will make it do, we'll make it three will make it forward

00:24.240 --> 00:24.990
and we will go.

00:25.590 --> 00:25.890
OK.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.860
And during this, we will also update our son.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.920
So what we will initially, two things will be OK.

00:32.610 --> 00:36.870
I S1 the initial value of the number and the sum is zero.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.280
So in order to do this, think we need a look, right?

00:41.820 --> 00:47.940
And for that, we discussed that we can use available to we had while followed by certain condition.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.800
We'll see what that condition is.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.800
That condition would be nothing but while.

00:54.370 --> 00:55.690
This value of I.

00:56.330 --> 01:04.420
OK, this value of AI is less than equal to N, if this is less than equal doing, we can keep on updating

01:04.420 --> 01:07.330
overtime so we can get some equal to someplace.

01:07.540 --> 01:15.670
So this is the work that we will do in every step, and we will also go to the next value of life that

01:15.670 --> 01:16.240
is like gold.

01:16.240 --> 01:24.250
Like this one, after we are out of the loop, we can print the value of some and then begin to exit.

01:24.460 --> 01:24.970
That's it.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.790
That is how we can write the pseudocode.

01:27.970 --> 01:28.210
OK.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.570
So if you want to go to a dry run this one so we can talk.

01:31.720 --> 01:38.210
The sum is zero is one that equals I'm blessed because one is less than equal to four.

01:38.610 --> 01:42.700
It's endless for so some becomes zero plus one.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.330
That is one.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.180
I becomes what I becomes two.

01:47.250 --> 01:47.550
OK.

01:48.330 --> 01:54.340
And it was less than equal to for Sam, equal to someplace, plus some becomes one plus two.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.170
That is three.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.710
I becomes three.

01:59.770 --> 02:06.790
Now I becomes three three is less than equal to Ford and some blasÃ©, so some becomes plus 3.6.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.080
OK.

02:08.770 --> 02:12.220
And I comes forward to it takes up this value.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.070
And again, for low as any, the before Suzanne becomes six plus four, that has been.

02:19.110 --> 02:26.640
And I Begum's faith, so as we see the veil of I becomes five and it is not listening to this look will

02:26.640 --> 02:30.430
stop and we will come to the line number 16.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.220
That does bring some.

02:33.030 --> 02:36.620
And here we will print Ben and we will exit.

02:36.630 --> 02:40.350
OK, that means this pseudocode is working perfectly fine.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.240
And that's all for this video.
