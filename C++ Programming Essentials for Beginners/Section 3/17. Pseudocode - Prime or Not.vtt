00:01.990 --> 00:06.640
Everyone in this lecture will discuss the pseudocode to check if a number is prime one or two.

00:07.360 --> 00:12.220
Let us recall the flowchart that we have drawn to check a number is prime or not.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.120
Now let us try to convert this flowchart into the code, OK?

00:16.780 --> 00:19.990
The first step is read and look read and.

00:21.770 --> 00:27.560
The next step is, Initialise, is because we are trying to find out it in the range to do n minus one,

00:27.560 --> 00:33.710
so he's OK, let equal to two and here which is a smaller then.

00:33.710 --> 00:36.560
And so here we also see that this is a part of a loop.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.080
This part is done repeatedly.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.210
We take while.

00:42.620 --> 00:47.960
I is less than and are you going to do violence less than equal to n minus one?

00:48.650 --> 00:49.370
Both are fine.

00:50.470 --> 00:56.880
To hear what you're doing, you're repeatedly checking the foreign number and you're checking that,

00:56.890 --> 01:00.060
is there any adviser in the range to do and minus one?

01:00.100 --> 01:07.000
So the value of I is going from two trillion minus one that is less than to what you're taking hit.

01:07.030 --> 01:09.790
Your checking is and divisible by.

01:09.940 --> 01:13.600
So you will if it OK, this is this is not a look.

01:13.690 --> 01:15.190
This is a starting point of the law.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.010
This is if if.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.410
And is divisible by I.

01:23.790 --> 01:28.500
If an is divisible by then, what are you going to do?

01:29.400 --> 01:32.230
You can simply say that this number is not prime and you can ignore.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.400
This is what we have seen, so we're going to print.

01:36.670 --> 01:37.450
Not Prime.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.420
And begin to exit as soon as we get one device that.

01:46.030 --> 01:47.360
We consider this number is not.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.850
And we can exit, OK.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.790
So for this very look, we have to stop being territorial.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.520
We have written the work that needs to be done.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.930
We have done the initial look and listen to what is left as the update condition, OK.

01:59.350 --> 02:03.570
So if an is not divisible by, I then go to the next day.

02:03.670 --> 02:04.000
OK.

02:04.450 --> 02:11.500
That is basically the step I do one day, so it becomes I equal to a plus one.

02:13.110 --> 02:13.410
OK.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.540
I called up this one.

02:16.020 --> 02:22.590
Now, if you come out of this vile loop, that means you could not find a device that in this range

02:22.970 --> 02:29.040
it would do and minus one if suppose you get that he has a device that often you would simply hit the

02:29.070 --> 02:29.550
exit.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.800
But if you're not coming out of the loop, that means you have scanned all numbers still in minus one

02:35.250 --> 02:36.810
and you could not hit the exit.

02:37.590 --> 02:43.680
That is why you're coming to this line, where you going to print this as a prime number.

02:43.680 --> 02:50.220
So basically this direction, if you come out of the loop, you can joke that this number is a prime

02:50.220 --> 02:50.610
number.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.230
And now you can hit the exit.

02:53.410 --> 02:54.730
Your program is complete.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.320
OK, now let us brighten this for an example, it's a seven.

03:00.340 --> 03:05.530
So what happens, you start from two do does not divide seven, you make it three.

03:05.990 --> 03:10.090
OK, we go to three to three is less than seven.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.890
Three does not divide seven.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.730
You make it four.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.160
OK, so you come here again for what, less than seven?

03:17.790 --> 03:19.650
Or does not divide seven?

03:20.250 --> 03:21.030
So you come here.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.020
You make it five.

03:23.260 --> 03:27.500
Five does not divide, seven, you make it six fixes less than seven.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.150
But six does not divide seven.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.130
You will again come here.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.410
And finally, you make it seven.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.770
The value of I is now seven, which is not less than him.

03:36.220 --> 03:38.350
And you end up with this line.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.060
I knew circa seven is up and I'm am.

03:40.330 --> 03:41.100
And that is true.

03:41.110 --> 03:43.270
Seven itself is a prime number.

03:43.270 --> 03:45.180
And then you exit a couple.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.150
The number like nine.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.220
OK, what happens about nine?

03:48.710 --> 03:50.170
You start from an equal to two.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.400
It does not divide it with less than nine.

03:54.730 --> 03:56.080
Two does not divide nine.

03:56.860 --> 03:58.420
So you come here, you make it three.

03:59.890 --> 04:03.440
It is less than nine, but nine Model three.

04:03.590 --> 04:12.830
This is equal to zero, and hence you print that nine is not time and exit writing exit here means nothing

04:12.920 --> 04:17.360
below exit would get executed and that is the end of your program.

04:17.810 --> 04:25.280
OK, so that is how you can draw a flowchart and to try to look good logic if a number is prime or not,

04:25.340 --> 04:28.040
get so a quick recap of what we have done.

04:28.940 --> 04:38.260
So we start from, let's say, riding bicycles to two while I is less than and keep on dividing, OK?

04:38.960 --> 04:41.690
So if an is divisible by I.

04:43.020 --> 04:48.720
Then you can say, OK, this number is not trying to bring, not prime and exit.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.420
Otherwise, you go to the next location.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.040
I called you, I +1.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.110
And if you come out of the loop, that means you could not find a device that you can simply separate

04:58.110 --> 05:00.630
prime and then you can exert, OK.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.560
That is the complete robot for this program.

05:04.860 --> 05:05.390
Thank you.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.110
I hope you have understood this logic now.
