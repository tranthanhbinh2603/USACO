Hi, everyone.

00:02.510 --> 00:08.110
So let us writers who report for computing simple interest, so we have to read BRT and compute simple

00:08.110 --> 00:08.530
interest.

00:09.130 --> 00:12.880
So as we're discussing the flowchart, the first step is always read.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.140
The first step is start.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.990
In this case, we will not have to start.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.870
We're going to read B, R and B.

00:21.340 --> 00:21.880
All right.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.370
Then we will compute simple interest.

00:24.610 --> 00:29.680
That is B into R into B divided by 100.

00:29.890 --> 00:33.100
OK, so we can put this like this?

00:34.280 --> 00:38.970
And then we can look brand, simple interest and exit.

00:39.290 --> 00:39.860
That's it.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.270
That's the four line good to compute, simple interest.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.490
And this is that look good, OK?

00:46.970 --> 00:49.910
So I hope you have understood this pseudocode.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.830
And that's all for this video.
