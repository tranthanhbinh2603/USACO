00:00.510 --> 00:04.830
In this video, I will show you the solutions for the questions given in.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.870
So I have some questions and the question of open records.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.730
So let us solve them.

00:11.980 --> 00:12.220
Right.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.620
I will try and solve them.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.360
So I hope you have done it already.

00:15.750 --> 00:22.290
But just to confirm your results or if you have missed anything so you can understand me, you have

00:22.290 --> 00:24.010
gone wrong, so let us do it.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.740
I have first question here.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.060
This is the first question, this recursive function, and this is called for a fourth one.

00:32.190 --> 00:37.020
So we want the result of what the function of the written what is the result of a function if it is

00:37.020 --> 00:37.650
called for.

00:38.310 --> 00:43.740
So there is a function like recursive function Harborplace already have shown you.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.660
So the tracing tree will be prepared.

00:45.660 --> 00:45.960
Right.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.710
So let us start preparing, tracing three F one.

00:49.890 --> 00:56.630
So fossickers F of one then inside the function if you see there is a static variable.

00:56.940 --> 01:02.640
So already in the video I have discussed about the static variables and recursive function they will

01:02.640 --> 01:04.250
maintain on this single copy.

01:04.530 --> 01:07.100
So this i.e. only one copy will be maintained.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.340
So don't put it in the tracing separately.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.490
Keep eye here.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.460
So it is treated just like a global variable.

01:14.460 --> 01:23.640
So it's values, one that said now stock if and this is greater than equal to 500 done in NSW, now

01:23.640 --> 01:25.110
one and this one.

01:25.410 --> 01:32.010
And there does not appear to court to fight the next step and assign and plus I so I will change it.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.350
And this one.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.330
So one plus I, I use one which one.

01:36.540 --> 01:42.930
So N becomes homage to this is two and is two right now that eight plus plus.

01:43.050 --> 01:46.950
So the it is static so here should become two.

01:47.070 --> 01:47.990
I'm writing it here.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.340
So I became two then written, written more often.

01:52.530 --> 01:55.450
So again the function is called for the value of N.

01:55.710 --> 01:56.970
So there's a recursive call.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.740
So I plus there.

01:58.740 --> 02:01.970
So I have not shown it to you if you want to it.

02:02.160 --> 02:02.460
Right.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.170
So I am taking all the steps now.

02:04.180 --> 02:04.980
This one and this one.

02:04.980 --> 02:14.580
And this one next is call for two and it's two function is call again for two then this is a declaration.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.430
This is all because it is static, it is done only once.

02:17.430 --> 02:17.880
Right.

02:17.910 --> 02:18.990
So it is not done again.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.120
Again, don't think that it becomes one.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.160
If you're doing it then you get wrong answer.

02:23.790 --> 02:24.600
That is static.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.210
It is done only once, not right now.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.970
The value of is to.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
We are not in the first call, we are in the second column.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.680
Yes, that is a static.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.870
It remains as it is in the second column.

02:36.870 --> 02:42.360
So yes then it is it doesn't equal the five as it an equal to five.

02:42.360 --> 02:42.780
No.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.310
Then these three steps.

02:44.490 --> 02:52.260
So first step is work and assign and the plus I say what is n to what is I do.

02:52.350 --> 02:53.910
So how much is enough.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.780
Edness for the next step is a plus plus eight plus plus and minus three.

03:01.770 --> 03:06.930
The next call again it's for fun of n what is in right now.

03:07.390 --> 03:11.510
Four for now.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.990
Let us do this step quickly.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.650
This is what all the need is right now.

03:16.650 --> 03:19.050
Three and is equal to five.

03:19.050 --> 03:20.880
No it is not greater than or equal to five.

03:20.890 --> 03:22.230
Done then then fine plus eight.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.430
And is how much right now for so four plus I is how much.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.000
Three.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.050
So this is how much.

03:28.050 --> 03:29.700
Seven then eight plus.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.670
Plus so plus plus mix this.

03:31.680 --> 03:38.610
As for then call function F off and what is then seven.

03:40.720 --> 03:46.180
No, it comes here at seven seven greater than or equal to five, so this is great.

03:46.570 --> 03:54.760
So do what Raytown and what does that seven written and so seven is written here then.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.580
And this is a statement if you see this for that statement.

03:57.580 --> 03:57.760
Right.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.940
So what is written here written.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.410
So whatever the result is that is written.

04:02.650 --> 04:04.670
So seven is written from here also.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.510
So it is seven here.

04:06.790 --> 04:09.820
Then again it is the same statement, same statement from here only.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.200
We have got so written from here also.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.470
So this is written.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.440
So this is seven.

04:14.620 --> 04:17.570
So finally the answer for this one is seven.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.740
So the result of this function is seven.

04:20.770 --> 04:25.770
So if you have not maintained a single copy of A, then you might have got wrong results.

04:25.910 --> 04:26.210
Right?

04:27.070 --> 04:28.750
So this is the result that is valid.

04:28.750 --> 04:29.250
Seven.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.420
So answer for this is seven.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.570
Let us look at second question.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.350
So here is a program that is second question.

04:38.350 --> 04:42.370
Of course it is a little and the let us trace this Froggatt.

04:42.760 --> 04:47.980
See here, the main function and also a function for so main function is calling for.

04:48.250 --> 04:52.150
So let us look at the data with most of the variables of main function.

04:52.180 --> 04:59.860
So what are the variables of main function e which is having value to zero for eight then some, which

04:59.860 --> 05:02.010
is having value zero.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.460
And this belongs to me.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.510
I like them here.

05:06.580 --> 05:07.380
This belongs to me.

05:07.390 --> 05:15.850
And the main function called for by passing A and some A and some so it goes into N and some goes into

05:15.850 --> 05:21.010
that some first and foremost thing is it called a value called bitter.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.170
Friends are called but address what it is.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.870
This is called by value here.

05:25.870 --> 05:30.330
Stars are not written, so it's not called Bertus and bosons are not there.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.770
So this is not called by reference.

05:31.810 --> 05:32.880
This is called a value.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.280
So let us appraise this function for now.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.110
So here, full escort.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.520
So first value as to zero for it and some is zero.

05:43.870 --> 05:50.290
So two variables and will have two zero four eight and some will be zero.

05:51.520 --> 05:55.640
Then if any is equal to zero return, it's going to stop.

05:55.710 --> 05:56.730
Redundant stop.

05:56.740 --> 06:02.080
And this is why the time is not going to return any value redundance just to stop.

06:02.710 --> 06:03.860
Then how many steps are there.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.260
One, two, three, four, five steps are there.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.340
So let us perform this a step further.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.870
Step aside and the more the tenth.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.480
So what will be the value of K more written.

06:15.580 --> 06:23.020
How much it this if you divide into this number by then then the remainder will be eight smartarse eight.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.100
The next step GFI and then divide by ten.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.740
So G assign and divided by ten.

06:30.010 --> 06:31.420
So that is to zero for eight.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.770
So you divided by ten.

06:32.770 --> 06:33.690
Eight will be gone.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.990
It will be two hundred and four.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.060
So we will not fall.

06:39.310 --> 06:41.200
Some are saying some people are scared.

06:41.230 --> 06:44.940
So what is the value of some zero sum plus a K?

06:45.070 --> 06:48.610
So Zablocki So some will be Zablocki is how much?

06:48.620 --> 06:49.060
Eight.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.420
So some will be eight.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.430
The next step, call it some for.

06:55.890 --> 06:58.750
And some call it some form.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.650
Gee, that is two zero 04.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.790
And the sum is how much.

07:03.790 --> 07:08.190
Eight then one more step in the game.

07:08.590 --> 07:14.320
So this is a step that a lot of people are known because it has called itself so this will perform at

07:14.320 --> 07:15.340
returning time.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.290
So we will do it at same time.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.280
So I'll just leave a line here.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.090
Here we have the key.

07:21.310 --> 07:25.720
So whatever the value of that, it will not not aggregate in time.

07:26.020 --> 07:32.530
So let us continue with this call now, this call and this call, also same steps, same steps, so

07:32.530 --> 07:35.160
kerosine, more tangible sign, divide written.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.540
And in some case, I did so key.

07:38.560 --> 07:49.390
A sign written for four G assign divided by 10 for 20 some assign some plus a K eight is a sum plus

07:49.390 --> 07:49.850
four.

07:49.870 --> 07:54.450
So this is 12 that call itself for mixed values.

07:54.460 --> 08:02.710
That is G and some sort of 20 and 12 and also print that printing will be done afterwards.

08:02.860 --> 08:09.220
So all the steps I have the one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four fifty one will

08:09.220 --> 08:12.430
be done that time continuum.

08:12.850 --> 08:16.360
And this one, this call it will make this call again.

08:16.360 --> 08:24.000
These are steps so kesi in the mod so they demanded then is how much zettl and 20 divided.

08:24.020 --> 08:24.990
But that is how much.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.640
So that's two times divided.

08:27.910 --> 08:30.280
Then someone signed some plus key.

08:30.490 --> 08:40.630
Some is two plus two is it will only then call itself four G and some so to command twelve and also

08:40.630 --> 08:41.370
it has to print.

08:41.380 --> 08:45.040
I'll just remove this, it has to print but it will not be done now.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.360
It will be done afterwards.

08:46.510 --> 08:47.540
Now one more call.

08:47.890 --> 08:54.790
So this one again, those are steps can be assigned and the mountain to mountain is how much to only

08:55.510 --> 08:57.250
gasline and divided by ten.

08:57.460 --> 08:58.300
Divided by ten.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.800
So Gevalia will be how much.

09:00.010 --> 09:00.580
Zero.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.850
Then someone assign some BlueSky.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.800
So some is right now twelve.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.700
So in that two is that it.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.210
So this becomes fourteen then one more call with the foo.

09:11.230 --> 09:14.350
So I have to remove this also to just makerspace.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.580
You know very well about this.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.360
Then for one more call.

09:18.370 --> 09:21.880
What is that G and some Zetterlund 14.

09:22.090 --> 09:25.040
And also it has to print this will be done afterwards.

09:25.720 --> 09:31.750
Now Discon miscall when it comes here and is equal to zero written.

09:32.940 --> 09:33.850
This has to stop.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.470
It will not go further.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.840
This will stop, this call will not go further.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.550
So it will come back to this call for what it has to do, remaining predicate.

09:43.590 --> 09:53.180
So what is key to do is print and then this finishes this then is then then go back to the previous

09:53.190 --> 09:55.180
column and perform this a step.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.930
So what is the next step, Frank?

09:57.090 --> 09:57.510
How much?

09:57.510 --> 09:58.350
It is zero.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.580
So this is zero.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.970
Then this finishes go back to the previous call in this one.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.570
So this is the remaining print game.

10:05.610 --> 10:08.070
What is escape for print for?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.610
Then go back to the previous call.

10:10.830 --> 10:16.250
This is remaining so gave what is eight eight two zero four eight.

10:16.590 --> 10:25.790
And this function ends its function ends so distressing as or it returns back to the main function is

10:25.800 --> 10:27.020
the main function from here.

10:27.030 --> 10:33.150
It was can't fool from here Toscana now next step.

10:33.600 --> 10:40.500
But in some which some main functions, some how much it is zettl.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.910
This is not change.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.740
It became 14.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.410
This was belonging to full function.

10:46.410 --> 10:52.920
It doesn't belong to main function, main function some as Z only it is called what value.

10:53.040 --> 10:57.710
It is not modified so friends some as Zettl.

10:58.650 --> 10:59.290
Yes.

10:59.340 --> 11:04.290
Does the answer to zero four eight and zero is a that.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.960
If you got the answer then it is perfect.

11:07.350 --> 11:11.460
If you can't answer that is to zero for eight and 14.

11:11.460 --> 11:15.600
When you have mistaken, you thought that this is so much more defined.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.520
We are adding this one note that is belonging to full function.

11:19.530 --> 11:20.910
It's not related to this.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.470
So this is not modified.

11:23.490 --> 11:24.240
So that's all.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.550
This is the tracing.

11:25.560 --> 11:31.080
This is a little bit lendee because so many operations are there in the function and the result is two

11:31.080 --> 11:33.100
zero four eight zero.

11:34.170 --> 11:36.300
Now, let us look at third question.

11:39.570 --> 11:41.800
Let us look at the third example.

11:41.940 --> 11:47.030
Third question from quiz one, this is the program given the example.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.080
So let us study this one.

11:49.620 --> 11:54.600
Since the information I have not given in the question, but for explanation, I have written it here.

11:56.280 --> 12:04.170
In description 17 is there, so it says that if he's having five and it is past one value by reference,

12:04.170 --> 12:08.900
another value by value, so yes, he's there, this belonged to main function.

12:08.910 --> 12:10.470
So let us draw it, OK?

12:10.860 --> 12:19.320
B is having value five, then function F, it's scarred by passing P two times, but the first time

12:19.320 --> 12:20.640
is by reference.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.890
You remember this reference, right.

12:23.250 --> 12:27.470
C++ reference then this is by volume one is by reference.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.640
I don't know what it's about value.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.630
So those two walk past so it is nothing but a P only pos.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.670
No these are the statements so let us trace this one.

12:35.680 --> 12:44.510
So right on that function f ok first one is X and the second one is called the value C in the tracing

12:44.530 --> 12:45.120
function.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.820
If it is by value, I have directly written the value.

12:48.150 --> 12:53.260
So what is the value of a P five so that C will have the value five solid five year.

12:53.650 --> 12:57.120
OK, I don't have great C but that X is a reference.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.620
Don't try to fight there.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.370
If it is reference, don't write it so that X is nothing.

13:02.370 --> 13:07.290
But could this be only this would be only that P actually belongs to me in function.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.040
This is the important thing in this function.

13:11.370 --> 13:14.370
If you have understood this then you can trace it perfectly.

13:15.180 --> 13:19.550
None of the first step C assign C minus one.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.740
So what C become C was a five nine minus one.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.600
When C becomes four, if a C is equal to zero, no.

13:26.610 --> 13:28.050
Otherwise it should return one.

13:28.230 --> 13:31.350
It's not zero then exercised X plus one.

13:31.350 --> 13:34.730
So exercising X plus one means X will increment.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.260
So what is this one.

13:36.510 --> 13:39.090
So this should increment and it should become six.

13:40.170 --> 13:50.040
I made it six then call functions one by F of X commerce C call again itself by passing F of X comma

13:50.040 --> 13:52.740
c c is what for then.

13:52.740 --> 13:57.750
Why I'm writing X because that X is nothing with reference to this B as a reference for this.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.390
B every time when I say X I will come here.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.600
OK then into X is there.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.890
So I keep it as it is.

14:04.890 --> 14:09.330
I will not take the value and multiply because it will not be multiplied right now.

14:09.630 --> 14:12.510
Then the multiplication will be done at returning time.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.200
It will be done.

14:13.410 --> 14:19.560
So because this is done after getting the value then you can multiply the if you want to multiply now

14:19.620 --> 14:23.410
right now X is almost six six in the what what will multiply.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.520
So first of all, this value should be there, then it can be multiplied.

14:26.790 --> 14:27.830
So don't wait six.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.970
Let it be X only that time only we will see.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.710
Well, it has to multiply that time, it will go to be the value.

14:36.230 --> 14:39.340
OK, so leave it as it is, not discord.

14:39.350 --> 14:40.730
We have to continue for that.

14:41.240 --> 14:46.670
So this was the first call I have explained in detail, not meaning I'll just repeat them.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.380
XCOM, for example, for C assigned C minus one.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.530
So C becomes how much?

14:52.550 --> 14:55.300
A three then C zero.

14:55.520 --> 14:55.940
No.

14:56.180 --> 15:04.010
So exercise plus one for exercising X plus one will make it as seven because this X is nothing but this

15:04.010 --> 15:04.280
one.

15:05.040 --> 15:14.180
Then call it self again by passing X comma C value is a three and then two x one more call.

15:15.350 --> 15:22.340
Then in Discon, again, CSI on C minus one, subsea becomes how much it is three, so it becomes two,

15:22.730 --> 15:25.270
then Nexxus exercise next plus one.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.930
So this becomes eight.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.720
Then again, it will call itself X Gamma C is it to two and two X.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.270
We will see it afterwards.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.230
Then again, call.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.920
So it's common to be assigned to minus one.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.420
So C becomes a much one.

15:42.110 --> 15:43.560
C is it equal to zero.

15:43.580 --> 15:44.750
No, not zero.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.060
Then enter inside same X plus one.

15:47.090 --> 15:49.420
So X becomes how much exercise.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.090
X plus one.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.590
So this is nothing but B only remember nine.

15:53.980 --> 15:58.850
Then again call itself by passing F and that is X.

15:58.850 --> 16:05.540
Gomaa sees how much one then into X and keeping it X only at every time.

16:05.630 --> 16:05.880
Right.

16:06.320 --> 16:14.360
I'm not taking the value that this one X Common-Law X on my one C assigned C minus one.

16:14.630 --> 16:16.220
So C becomes how much.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.940
Zero is a C equal to zero.

16:19.940 --> 16:21.470
Yes C became zero.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.800
A written one.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.320
So this function returns one.

16:25.790 --> 16:28.820
So now from here it will return back.

16:29.060 --> 16:34.490
So this returns the same function that it becomes one one into X.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.420
What is X now.

16:35.450 --> 16:37.090
Nine nine.

16:37.570 --> 16:38.510
This is nine.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.570
This nine is written.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.510
So this is the result.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.880
This is nine in the X.

16:43.970 --> 16:44.960
Now you go to X.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.320
What is X nine only.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.220
So this is into nine.

16:48.230 --> 16:49.430
So this is nine squared.

16:49.730 --> 16:51.680
So this is return to this one.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.930
So this is nine squared into X.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.250
What is nine X nine only.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.550
So this is nine Q and this is written.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.820
So this is nine two and two X.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.230
What is X nine only.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.180
So does this nine four.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.670
And this is written.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.760
So this is nine.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.450
Bouwer four.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.670
Yes, this is the answer.

17:11.690 --> 17:16.400
So the answer is done by four nine point forty six five six one.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.940
So yes, disdain for this question.

17:20.280 --> 17:26.130
Now, if you've got the wrong answer means you have not done it properly, you have not referred to

17:26.130 --> 17:27.080
this one every time.

17:28.140 --> 17:31.680
And one more reason of getting a wrong answer is you are writing the values here.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.680
First time it was six, then you wrote seven underneath the night.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.620
So six, seven, eight, nine.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.030
So you are multiplying this one in such form.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.910
And one more mistake that we're were doing it.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.400
You are increasing up to ten here.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.620
Also, you are doing it up to ten.

17:46.860 --> 17:51.510
So commonly this type of mistakes are possible if you're not solving it properly.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.610
So this is the answer for this quiz question.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.500
Next, we will go to the next question.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.750
And our next question is this one.

18:03.290 --> 18:08.510
A function is given and we have to find out what is the result of dysfunction, if it is called for

18:08.870 --> 18:11.090
five value, five percent in five.

18:11.810 --> 18:13.220
So we have to trace this one.

18:14.710 --> 18:22.170
Let us do it first time I'm sending five so far, five fun of five.

18:23.630 --> 18:24.040
Then.

18:25.210 --> 18:26.450
These are local variables.

18:26.470 --> 18:30.340
Yes, these are not static, so in every call, Exel become one.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.940
Remember, this is also newly created in every call.

18:34.140 --> 18:43.510
OK, we will use them and is equal to one --'s noid is not one that Forcier sign one to less than

18:43.630 --> 18:45.010
one to less than in this.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.220
One, two, three, four.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.580
So Forcier, find one, two, three, four.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.790
This is statements are repeated.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.410
So one, two, three, four.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.230
So many times they are repeated.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.270
So let us do it.

18:56.770 --> 18:59.940
This is a sign X plus what.

19:00.760 --> 19:01.450
First one.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.930
First one is what for North Carolina values.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.010
What came out of this one.

19:07.030 --> 19:10.640
So this is a one off, one comma and the minus one.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.420
So what is then.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.620
Fine fun of one in two phonons.

19:14.860 --> 19:20.210
Four then plus because this is going to be added in two X every time.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.120
So again, one more time.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.950
So that time is how much you do right now is a two.

19:25.990 --> 19:33.430
So this is the final four to end the fun of five minus two.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.690
That is three then plus this isn't for loop.

19:37.690 --> 19:39.280
Repeat one more time.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.560
One more time.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.430
So this is a continuum.

19:42.700 --> 19:46.560
There is more space so fond of will be the three.

19:46.570 --> 19:56.750
So this is a three in front of five, minus three as a two then plus one more time.

19:56.920 --> 20:07.420
Now this time cavel before so far off for indoor fun of and the minus one that is in the minus kid that

20:07.420 --> 20:10.020
is five minus for this one.

20:10.570 --> 20:14.590
So so many calls for just four, not five.

20:15.190 --> 20:16.360
Solenni calls are there.

20:16.630 --> 20:17.650
This is complex.

20:18.040 --> 20:21.080
You cannot solve it easily by using pen and paper.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.820
So in this we should finish this one than this one.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.370
So I don't know how much expansion this will take.

20:27.610 --> 20:28.990
And this one and this one.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.480
All these you should know, then multiply and get the result.

20:31.810 --> 20:32.830
So this is not easy.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.080
It's not easy then how to solve it.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.330
So for solving this one will take another approach.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.860
Let us see this one.

20:41.230 --> 20:47.590
So here I will take the values of fun of M and for the values of.

20:47.590 --> 20:49.650
And so I'll make it as a table.

20:50.980 --> 20:54.010
Let us do it then I'll tell you why I'm taking table.

20:54.430 --> 21:00.760
So first C what is the minimum value and is equal to one if any equals to one.

21:00.970 --> 21:04.420
If I call this function bypassing one, not five.

21:04.510 --> 21:07.680
If I call it by passing one, then what happens.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.250
Let us get to that value.

21:10.060 --> 21:15.730
OK, so first we will find small little value, then slowly will increase and get the value for five

21:15.730 --> 21:16.010
years.

21:16.010 --> 21:17.130
So that is the idea.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.000
So then end this one.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.020
What is the result.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.580
Right on X.

21:21.610 --> 21:22.550
What is X one.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.760
So does one answer this one.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.800
So now we know for of one as one fan of one is one.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.110
Right.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.120
The next one of two we need this also.

21:33.130 --> 21:33.400
Right.

21:33.610 --> 21:36.160
So I'm not making a tree and making a table.

21:36.310 --> 21:40.690
So let us find an offer to solve one of two men swap.

21:41.060 --> 21:45.400
So two months and it's not one it will enter here.

21:45.640 --> 21:53.140
So how many times the slope will repeat K as one, K as one up to less than two.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.660
So it will only for one time.

21:55.930 --> 21:56.950
So let us do it.

21:57.100 --> 22:06.280
So for final four to four two it will be X plus make fun of KS.

22:06.340 --> 22:14.680
What one gives one in fun of doing minus one gives one night.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.230
Only one time it will repeat.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.330
Just observed that there's nothing to explain.

22:19.330 --> 22:21.270
You have to read and understand.

22:21.610 --> 22:25.360
So this for loop will repeat for only one time that statement.

22:25.360 --> 22:25.930
I don't care.

22:26.650 --> 22:27.670
So what are the values.

22:27.940 --> 22:28.930
It's only this much.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.160
That's only one time.

22:30.490 --> 22:31.600
So how much is this.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.790
This is X is how much.

22:33.790 --> 22:37.350
One final one here.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.090
We already know for off on this one.

22:39.100 --> 22:45.040
OK, Digitas one in the form of two minus one to minus one is what one.

22:45.250 --> 22:45.850
This is one.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.620
Oh this like in front of one.

22:47.830 --> 22:50.110
Already know how much it is one.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.500
So this is one plus one in the one.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.300
So one plus one and one is how much.

22:55.630 --> 22:56.530
One plus one.

22:56.590 --> 22:57.460
That is two.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.480
Yes.

22:58.720 --> 23:02.480
One of two is two three.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.200
That it.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.710
So we have another one also one of two also let us find one of three, let us find one of three three.

23:12.010 --> 23:14.650
So one of three then.

23:14.650 --> 23:18.010
It is a three X plus it is not the one.

23:18.010 --> 23:19.150
So it will enter inside.

23:19.450 --> 23:22.660
So this kid takes values from one to three.

23:23.170 --> 23:24.420
So how does.

23:24.890 --> 23:30.230
Repeat one and kill less than three months, one and two, two times it will repeat, so it will take

23:30.230 --> 23:34.940
two this one time, one second to let us put it here.

23:35.150 --> 23:43.250
So X plus fun off is one and one off and the minus.

23:43.540 --> 23:50.720
So what is entry rate three three minus one plus one more time, which will repeat four plus it will

23:50.720 --> 23:52.780
be accumulated in this one on added in this one.

23:53.450 --> 23:55.910
So this time fun on four days.

23:55.910 --> 23:57.740
How much do you think it has to.

23:58.010 --> 24:07.130
So this is three minus two so far enough to enable fun of three minus two.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.340
OK, I'll remove this.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.770
So now let us solve it.

24:12.230 --> 24:15.640
This is one OK, one plus four.

24:15.650 --> 24:19.540
Last one we already know and this one in two.

24:20.030 --> 24:21.830
What is this fun of.

24:21.830 --> 24:24.590
Three minus one three minus one is too far off to.

24:24.590 --> 24:27.950
What is the value of one of two we know it said is the benefit.

24:27.950 --> 24:29.390
We already know small little value.

24:29.690 --> 24:33.860
So this is one to two plus four of two.

24:34.130 --> 24:40.640
It is to just rerouted two in the into four three minus two, three minus two is how much.

24:40.640 --> 24:45.050
One last one is what one then total.

24:45.050 --> 24:51.230
How this is one plus one two two two plus two in the one is two so this is five.

24:52.070 --> 24:57.080
So if you got down to five so this is five now.

24:57.080 --> 25:02.090
Next is four four and then of five.

25:03.330 --> 25:07.960
That's all you can get it now for fun or for I will not read all these things directly.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.130
I don't answer.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.630
OK, then also four or five.

25:11.890 --> 25:20.410
So I'll remove this and I will use the place for for formants KTXA values from one to less than four.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.750
So Gay is going to take the values one, two and three.

25:25.360 --> 25:30.790
So let us start exis one first time Fanaroff one will do four minus one.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.910
So F off one and two four minus one.

25:34.240 --> 25:38.980
So four minus one is what, a three plus F for four keys are two now.

25:39.220 --> 25:46.270
So into four minus two as a two plus F of three games, three right now.

25:46.270 --> 25:50.860
So treatments for fall minus three is one so holiness's.

25:50.980 --> 25:54.100
So let us is this, this is one for one is how much.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.140
One incoll.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.380
One of three is how much.

25:56.380 --> 25:56.620
What.

25:56.620 --> 25:59.500
Five plus four of two is a two.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.940
So this is twenty two.

26:01.630 --> 26:03.610
That's one of three is a five in front.

26:03.610 --> 26:04.510
Off one is one.

26:04.510 --> 26:07.840
So hemolysis five plus five.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.150
Ten ten plus four.

26:10.510 --> 26:13.230
Fourteen plus one fifteen.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.350
So this is fifteen then.

26:17.770 --> 26:18.880
Final five.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.290
Final five is how much.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.550
One plus.

26:22.390 --> 26:24.160
Now can we take the values.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.770
One, two, three and four.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.190
So Air Force One is one four for this.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.770
Seems like this one is multiplied with four.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.700
So four for this.

26:33.700 --> 26:37.030
Fifteen plus two with the three.

26:37.030 --> 26:44.290
So two with the three months, twenty five point five then plus then three in the boom.

26:44.290 --> 26:46.420
So five in the two, five and the two.

26:46.420 --> 26:50.680
If you have observed this then you can directly like this then forward into one.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.210
So fifteen into one.

26:52.330 --> 26:53.470
Fifteen to one.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.210
How much distance.

26:55.660 --> 27:02.140
One plus fifteen plus five to ten and five to 10 and 15.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.610
Fifteen fifteen.

27:03.610 --> 27:06.000
Thirty, forty, fifty, fifty one.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.290
So the answer is fifty one.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.150
So this is fifty one.

27:11.450 --> 27:13.010
That said, there's dance.

27:13.950 --> 27:19.360
So the main idea here is that we cannot find it by expanding it.

27:19.650 --> 27:25.660
We cannot do that, then we have to start finding the smaller values, then we can get this done.

27:26.130 --> 27:28.420
So that's all in discussion now.

27:28.620 --> 27:29.890
One more question is there.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.850
So let us look at the next question and which one.

27:34.030 --> 27:40.120
Now, let us look at next question, Chris, one, since is the program given there's a function and

27:40.120 --> 27:48.740
it is called for value voluntary, if you read this, the variables are and and there'd be only two

27:48.760 --> 27:51.130
variables are there, but these are static.

27:51.400 --> 27:55.140
So you remember when you have any static variable, you should take it separately.

27:55.150 --> 27:56.420
So let us put it as one.

27:58.030 --> 27:59.050
Now, what is difference?

27:59.050 --> 28:00.210
Say, just decided.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.380
OK, it's easy.

28:01.510 --> 28:02.310
Let us do it.

28:02.500 --> 28:07.370
So let us make a first call, C of three instead of down time saying just to see.

28:07.450 --> 28:12.390
OK, so C of the count of three stack this one.

28:12.400 --> 28:12.760
Yes.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.490
This over this initial right.

28:14.590 --> 28:16.050
We don't have to repeat it every time.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.630
And so what is N three.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.260
So print three.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.870
OK, here I will write on the output, what we get.

28:24.430 --> 28:28.840
So first time 3D printing then printed.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.470
B, what is the deal.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.970
It is printed now so devalue.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.010
What is that one.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.460
So one is printed.

28:35.470 --> 28:43.600
So one is printed then B plus plus plus plus B becomes two.

28:45.010 --> 28:49.620
If anything greater than one that count then minus one C A certificate.

28:49.630 --> 28:50.590
That one it is three.

28:50.950 --> 28:57.240
So count is call again for and the minus one sort of four to the next print.

28:57.460 --> 29:01.070
But first of all colors that finished that column then print.

29:01.250 --> 29:09.370
OK, printing will be done but not now afterwards then call for to continue from here again.

29:09.370 --> 29:12.260
Calls itself so again printing is that.

29:12.640 --> 29:24.220
So first print and and is how much to do next d d how much to do then the D plus plus plus plus D becomes

29:24.220 --> 29:26.970
three and this is greater than one.

29:27.010 --> 29:27.520
Yes.

29:27.870 --> 29:29.700
Call itself then minus one.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.460
So CS called four and the minus one to minus one one.

29:33.820 --> 29:37.020
Then after that building is there but not now, it will be done afterwards.

29:37.030 --> 29:40.060
See here also we left and we have to do it afterwards.

29:40.750 --> 29:44.720
This time sees one come again like print and.

29:44.910 --> 29:53.360
And this is what one print one then printed D how three so printed three then the plus plus.

29:53.620 --> 30:01.600
So this is ok one is printed and 3d printer then D plus plus so deeply becomes how much forward then.

30:01.610 --> 30:02.720
And this is greater than one.

30:02.950 --> 30:04.630
No it's not greater than one.

30:04.990 --> 30:05.950
So it doesn't cost.

30:06.130 --> 30:11.680
So boarding is not a done but after that printing is there some printing is done.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.450
So what is it for.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.840
So now this is the end point is going to print now.

30:16.850 --> 30:19.870
So this for for this printing.

30:21.760 --> 30:26.260
There is no call for to go back, so it goes back to the previous.

30:26.920 --> 30:33.040
So for this call, this is completed next year, their remaining print, this is print would be what

30:33.040 --> 30:33.990
is the Ford?

30:34.270 --> 30:35.790
So Ford is printed now.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.640
Then this call finishes.

30:38.650 --> 30:42.130
It goes back in this line like this one for this one.

30:42.490 --> 30:43.350
It is in this call.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.550
Now, this is a one Nixon's remaining.

30:45.550 --> 30:46.470
What is that print.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.690
But it won't be this.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.310
How much for support is printed.

30:49.720 --> 30:50.740
So this is Ford.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.350
So the answer is three.

30:53.350 --> 30:57.910
One, two, one three four four four instance.

30:58.950 --> 31:02.810
So that's all it is the tracing and explanation of all questions.

31:03.380 --> 31:03.600
Right.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.650
So you can write this program and test them.

31:05.650 --> 31:07.250
Also, you get the same result.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.050
So that's all with the quiz.

31:09.070 --> 31:09.980
One problems.
