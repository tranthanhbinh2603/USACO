00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,290
Hi Everyone, in this lecture we will talk about mathematical expectation and which is an important concept

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,640
in probability theory.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,900
And it is always good to learn about this concept because in programming also you might be facing

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,720
some problems which are related with calculating the expectation of something. OK?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,120
So let us talk about what is this term expectation.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,260
So expectation is kind of a weighted average value of a random variable.

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,190
Now you may ask what is a random variable?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,300
OK, so a random variable is one of the outcomes of phenomena or a random event

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:48,390
you can say. OK So random variable is one of the outcomes of an experiment. OK?

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,410
So now you may ask what is a experiment.

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,270
So let us denote.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,120
Let's take few examples of a random experiment.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,370
For example, you throw a coin.

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,530
OK, you throw a coin in the air.

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:08,270
And that coin may get a head or a tail as the outcome. OK, so we can say X is  random variable

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,550
that can take the value head or it can take the value tail. OK.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,430
Or maybe another example could be you throw a dice and this is a dice with six sides and you can get

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,910
the numbers in the range let's say one to six. OK.

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,750
So x is a random variable that can take the values one, two, three, four, five and six.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,590
Now I hope you understood what is a random variable.

21
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,100
.

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,280
So what is the expectation? we will calculate.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,890
What is the expected value if you throw a dice.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,700
OK, so it's kind of a weighted average. so we'll see how we can calculate this average.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:56,720
So mathematically, for a discrete variable x. ok. now let me also talk about the difference between

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,060
a discrete and a continuous variable ok. so

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,620
random variable come in to syllabus.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,500
They can have discrete values or they can have continuous values. OK?

29
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:17,150
For example, let's say X is a random variable that denotes what would be the temperature of today.

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,310
OK, the temperature for today.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,540
Today is a cold day so maybe I can say the temperature is around 10 degrees Celsius.

32
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,770
OK. but it can be 10.1.

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,420
It can be 10.2.

34
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,750
It can be 10.25.

35
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,310
.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:41,360
OK, now you can see X denotes the variable temperature for the day and it is a random variable and

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,150
it can take continuous values. OK?

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,960
It can take continuous values so we will say X is a continuous random variable whereas in case of throwing

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,620
a die, X can take only one of the fixed values.

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,550
OK. so one of the values in the range one to six.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,680
In this case, we say it is a discrete random variable because the outcomes have discrete values. OK?

42
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:17,210
The outcomes have discrete values so I hope you understood the difference between a continuous and

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,610
a discrete random variable.

44
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,960
Most of the problems that we would be discussing they would be based on the concept of discrete random

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,420
variables.

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,680
OK.

47
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,360
So mathematically, for a discrete random variable X with the probability function P of x the expected

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,910
value it is denoted using E of X is given by summation of Xi into P of Xi where P stand for the

49
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,950
probability of that particular value.

50
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,930
The summation runs over all distinct values of Xi, the variable can take.

51
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,250
OK.

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,710
So basically, if I have something like X. what is the possible values of Xi?

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,140
Say so x.. X can take the values zero. sorry In case of our die it can take the value one.

54
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,150
It can take value two.three four five and six.

55
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,080
So what is P(xi)? P(xi) denotes

56
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,399
What is the probability of each value of Xi.

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:26,150
OK, so if this is the ith outcome. the probability that this die will throw one by three, assuming

58
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,870
it is a fair die. OK. assuming it is a fair die. like every side has an equal probability of showing

59
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,990
up.

60
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,740
So we can say this probability is nothing but one by six, one by six, one by six, one by six

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,300
and one by six.

62
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,440
So each of the side has an equal probability.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,910
That is one by six.

64
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,320
And how do we calculate the expected value?

65
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,100
That can show up on a die.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,390
So that is nothing but summation of Xi into P(xi).

67
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,180
OK.

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,920
That is nothing but one multiplied by one by six plus two

69
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,450
Multiplied by one by six

70
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,590
Three multiplied by one

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,960
by six plus four

72
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,620
Into one

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,070
By six

74
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,190
Five by six and six by six.

75
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,460
OK.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,810
If you just find out this, it is nothing but one by six common. one plus two plus three plus four

77
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,340
plus five plus six.

78
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,680
This sum is what?

79
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,470
So this comes out to be 3.5.

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,440
OK. so now what you can say is 3.5 is the expected value.

81
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,250
It's some kind of average value that you can expect when a die is rolled, let's say infinite number

82
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,640
of times.

83
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,370
OK. so this is the expected value that you will get.

84
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,570
And this is not equal to the most probable value.ok.

85
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,380
It is not equal to the most probable values.

86
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,500
Expectation is not same as the most probable value because on a diet you can never get a value three point

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,860
five.

88
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,300
But this is kind of an average.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,780
If you do a lot of experiment of rolling die, the average would be close to this result.

90
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,880
This is what you can expect in the long run that your sum of values divided by the number of dies throws

91
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,990
would be close to 3.5.

92
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,720
This is what an expectation is.

93
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,610
Okay, so I hope you are able to understand what is the meaning of expectation.

94
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,360
Let me also talk about for a continuous variable with the probability density function P(x), since

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,850
a variable is const.. like it's continuous.

96
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,730
Let say the variable is like temperature and here we say.

97
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,060
OK?

98
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,670
Probability of having that particular temperature.

99
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,050
OK. so maybe it's a cold day.

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,100
So the average temperature maybe is around 10.

101
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,370
So maybe you might get this kind of a probability distribution curve.

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:56,240
So in this case, the expected value of E(x) or E of temperature is given by Xp(x) into the dx, so

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,060
basically you're doing this integration.

104
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,300
OK, so it is integration of xp(x) into the dx.

105
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,410
So this is nothing but this is again the area under the curve.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,180
So its integration is also a way of summing up.

107
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,290
But this is used for continues variables.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,310
So it's more into the mathematical side in programming.

109
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,800
You might not be needing to implement this integration formula in your code.

110
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,660
OK. it's going to be very, very, very rare.

111
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,260
OK.

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:36,020
But just to tell you that these two formulas are integration is like summation over the continuous

113
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,410
variable and the previous case that we just saw.

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,470
This is summation sign. it's for a discrete variable.

115
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,600
This can be easily implemented using for loop.You iterate over the values of X.

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,130
You should know the values of P(x) and you can find out the expected value of a given variable.

117
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,970
So that's all for this lecture.

118
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,920
And thank you.
