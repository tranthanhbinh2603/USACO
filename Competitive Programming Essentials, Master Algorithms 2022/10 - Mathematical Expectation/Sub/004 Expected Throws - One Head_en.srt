Hi Everyone, in this lecture we will discuss how we can approach some more problems involving the expectation.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,360
So let's go to through our first question.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,960
So it says what is the expected number of coin flips to get a head?

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,860
So let's discuss the approach that we will follow to solve all problems of this kind.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,260
So will assume that this expected number is x .OK and we want to calculate the x.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,720
So we have discussed that the expectation x.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,240
OK.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,790
So or you can say  E(x), whatever it is?

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,340
So we want to calculate this value.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,520
So what we are going to say? This is equal to summation of xi into P(xi), this is what we have

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:44,800
learned.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,120
OK.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,240
So what is p(xi)?

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,330
It is the probability of getting an outcome xi.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,690
OK, so what can be an outcome in this case?

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,780
If you throw a coin, you can get a head.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,550
You can get a tail.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,500
So suppose if you get ahead. Ok. that means you got the success in the first throw itself.

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,990
So how many throws you needed, you actually needed only one throw.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,790
So you needed only one throw.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,080
.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,450
OK.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,980
And what is the probability of getting the head in the first throw?

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,180
That is nothing but half.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,560
Ok. but what if if you don't get a head in the first throw, suppose you get a tail. Ok. let say you get

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,910
a tail. now

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
How many throws you would need to get a head?

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,320
OK.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,400
So effectively you have already wasted one throw.

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,200
And you're saying the expected number of throw to get a head is X.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,820
So effectively you would be needing X+1 number of throws.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,890
ok. this is an important thing

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,340
you need to understand that you have already wasted one throw. ok. and you did not get a head. suppose 

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,720
you got a tail in the first throw.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,080
OK, that means you got a tail and you're expecting you will require X number of more throw to get a head.

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,110
So the total number of throw would be 1+x.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,850
It would be 1+X.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,810
Into the probability of getting a failure in the first  throw  that means the probability of getting a

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,450
tail in the first throw that is again half.

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:27,270
ok. So this is equal to X. let us solve this equations so it becomes 2x+1+1+

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,690
x.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,230
This becomes the 2X-X.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,790
This is equal to two.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
And this gives us the final value of X that is equal to 2.

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,270
So yes, we can say we would required two number of throws to expect a head.

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,670
And that makes sense.

47
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,890
OK, that makes sense as well. ok.

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,270
So this is how you will frame kind of recursive relation.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,180
And you will try to solve this equation to get the number of coin flips together.

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,660
OK.

51
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,840
So let us see one more example in the next lecture.
