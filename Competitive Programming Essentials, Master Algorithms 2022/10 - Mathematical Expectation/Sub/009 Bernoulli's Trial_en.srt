Hi Everyone, so let's discuss this question of interviewing candidates.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,170
So it says candidates are appearing for interview one after another.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,350
The probability of each candidate getting selected is zero point one six.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,890
What is the expected number of candidates you would need to interview to make sure you at least select

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,430
somebody?

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,790
So that basically means what is the probability of getting a success in an interview, in how many trials

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,550
a candidate would become successful?

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,100
That's another way of framing this problem statement.

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,510
If you use the concept of a Bernoulli's style. is this evnet a Bernoulli's trial ?the answer is yes. so

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,200
either person can pass in the interview or it can fail in the interview.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,330
OK. so there are only two outcomes.

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,980
The probability of getting a success is 0.16.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,380
So how many trials you would need?

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,340
That is nothing but one by three.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,910
And this is equal to 6.25.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,210
.

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,580
So you can in seven interviews. OK, you can down rounded up to seven.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,410
You can say in seven interviews.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,300
You can say

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,880
You will select someone. you cannot take 6.25 interviews.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,440
You have to take seven interviews only.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,040
OK, doing interviews  interviews, you're going to select someone, OK?

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,390
And if you want to solve this using the equation method, you can still do it.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,900
So you can say X equals 0.16.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,950
If the person gets successful in the first interview then or if the person fails in the first interview,

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,440
then you would require X+1 more interviews ok so probability of getting a failure.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,410
That would be o1-0.6. 0.6 into x+1.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,830
OK.

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,060
You can simply solve this equation and again what you will get?  you will get X equals one up one

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,320
point one six.

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,620
This is again 6.25.

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,890
OK?

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,860
This is method one, which is using  Bernoulli's trial.

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,390
And this is the standard equation approach that we have already seen.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,590
So that's all for this video.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,240
Thanks a lot.
