00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,620
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,470
So let us increase the complexity of the question a little bit.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:12,550
And instead of saying two consecutive three consecutive votes, we are going to write for the general

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:12,940
case.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:19,510
What is the expected number of coin flips that are needed to get and consecutive it took?

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:27,040
So the answer will obviously depend upon the value of and so we need to analyze this and find out answer,

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,310
OK.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,730
So let's see how we can solve this problem.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,680
So what?

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,860
Let's assume that the transit is equal to X and we draw the line and suppose we get a failure in the

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,480
first row.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:48,620
OK, so the probability of getting a tail is one by two, and we would required X more troops to get

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
in consecutive if I took it.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,570
So it would be half multiplied with X plus one because we have already wasted one through.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,980
So this is one case.

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,140
Another case could be that in the first rule, we get ahead.

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,690
OK, the probability stuff.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,940
But in the next rule, we don't get ahead.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,470
So suppose we get a deal.

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,880
So that means we have wasted two throws and we would regret x more throws.

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,180
OK.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,820
So in total, we would be needing X Plus two throws to begin to get.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,840
It is one by two in the one by two in the X plus two.

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,050
Similarly, we may have we get ahead, we get ahead.

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,840
And now we get a failure.

26
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,890
We get a deal.

27
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:38,890
The probability is one by eight into x Exmoor throws, so it becomes explicitly so I can see one upon

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,760
one, divided by two by whether it is explicitly OK.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,750
Similarly, to keep on going in the worst case, what is going to happen?

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,930
We are going to say that suppose we get n minus one heads, OK?

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,910
And the net experiment gave us a tale, OK, in this case, what is going to happen again?

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,360
It would be one divided by two days to devouring.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,770
That means we have wasted and number two and number of troops and we have to do the experiment again,

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,940
which would expect X number of tries.

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:22,730
So it would be X Plus and we're going to plus one by two, raise the dividend into X plus and a rate.

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,430
Then there would be a case in which we get a success.

37
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,270
Suppose in all the interests, we get heads, what is the probability of this happening?

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,180
It would be one way to raise the and into how many trials we needed.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,270
We actually needed a number of trials.

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,450
OK, so that would be.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,660
And so it would be plus one way to raise the dividend in two and OK.

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,970
So this is the case where we get all the needs in a number of trials because this is where we just get

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
a success.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,210
But otherwise, even if there is one failure, then this would be the series that we would be getting.

45
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,360
OK, now let us try to simplify this.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,940
How we can solve this equation so we can say X equals what if I take X common out of all the dumps?

47
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:23,320
It would be like X in the one by two plus one by four plus one by eight up to up to one by two rated

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,320
to.

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,230
OK.

50
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,770
Less.

51
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,220
What are these terms?

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,260
One by two into this one by four, into this one by eight into this.

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:44,990
So it would be less one battle, less two by or less three by eight less four by 16 and so on.

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Less divided by and in duration.

55
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,420
Well, then less this term.

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,560
This term will carry a gun as it is and divided by the rest of the power.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,640
And now you may ask, how do we solve this equation, OK?

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,230
So if you now look carefully this equation that we are looking at?

59
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,770
This equation is a dramatic progression.

60
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,920
It's a job.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,329
So you know how to find the sum of in terms of GP.

62
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,440
It can be done.

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,060
What about this?

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,210
So in the denominator, this is deep in the numerator.

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,740
This is AP and this kind of a series is called as AGP.

66
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,160
OK.

67
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,560
So what you need to you need to find out the sum of in terms of the ultimate big geometric progression

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,890
that is again doable, that can be done.

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,230
And this term is a singledom.

70
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,840
And as you can handle separately, OK?

71
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,210
So I'm not going to solve this deep before you.

72
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,730
I'm just going to write down the result.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,930
So if you solve this equation, if you simplify, then what?

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,560
You're going to get it having to get the value of X storage to the IT and plus one minus two.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,780
This is doable.

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,110
OK.

77
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,510
This is the final result that you would be getting.

78
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,020
And you can verify if you put any equal or two.

79
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,870
Then in the previous example, for two consecutive heads, we got an answer as it becomes two plus one

80
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,620
minus two.

81
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,240
That is eight minus two.

82
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,490
That is six.

83
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,560
Yes, we derived this on that six in the previous example as well.

84
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,250
And that's so this this is the correct result.

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,250
We have not sold AGP 40.

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,760
We have no ideology before you.

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,750
So if you go back to your school level, maths are class 12 months, I think, then you should be able

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,750
to definitely able to derive this result.

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,230
Otherwise, you can just skip and go to the next problems as well.

90
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,520
OK.

91
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,590
So that's all for this we do.

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,760
And thanks a lot.
