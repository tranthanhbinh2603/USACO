Hi Everyone, so in this lecture we're going to talk about an important theorem which is known as linearity

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,510
of expectation.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,860
So basically, it is a theorem that state that

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,590
the expected value, the expected value of the sum of two random variables.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,670
ok, it can be more also, two or more random variables

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,350
is equal to the sum of... is equal to the sum of

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,460
expect sum of their individual expected values.. their individual.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,650
expected values. Ok. so now you may ask.

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,560
Let's try to make it more clear.

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,830
Ok. so these random variables can be dependent or they can be independent as well.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,570
Ok. so it does not matter whether the two random variables are dependent or they're independent.

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,269
Ok. so let me try to explain you with the help of an example.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,040
So this is how you state this mathematically that E(x1+x2)  is equal to E(x1) + E(x2).

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,040
Let us discuss one example, suppose we are playing a game in which we take the sum of the numbers

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,320
rolled on a  two six sided dice.

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,130
.

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,580
Calculate the expected value of sum of the rolls.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,620
Now you're throwing two dice

19
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,330
so what are the possible outcomes?

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,320
So you can..

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,720
You can see this matrix.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,530
ok. so the first on the first die you get one, on the second die you also get one.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,960
So the sum is two. on first die, you get one. on second die,  you get two. the sum is three and so on.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,240
So you will have basically six into six.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,550
You will have 36 outcomes.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,090
OK.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,370
And the probability of each outcome, you know it's going to be one by 36.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,030
OK.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,220
And now if you want to find out what is expected sum on the two die, so you will be doing OK one by

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,060
six, one by thirty six into two plus one by thirty six into three plus one by 36 into four.

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,630
OK.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,140
So all those sums you would be iterating upon

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,940
this you would be doing. now

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,830
The rule of linearity of expectation states that

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,490
So all the statistics moves, you would be upon. this is the basic method that we are doing OK.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,890
So but if we try to solve it smartly, if you use the rule of linearity of expectation, that is going

37
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:47,390
to basically say that this is nothing but equal to so we can say we want to find P(x1+x2)

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,050
So it basically says this expected values same as the expected value from the first die plus the

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,700
expected value from the second die.

40
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,170
So if you see this, this we have already seen that this is 3.5.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,610
This is also 3.5.

42
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,010
So we can finally say this sum is seven.

43
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:13,480
So by using this principle we are able to simplify this problem a lot instead of iterating over 36

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,440
possible cases.

45
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:24,070
We broke down into these two values that we already know and this is a rule of linearity of expectation

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,700
is going to help us to simplify the problem

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,360
statement. Okay.

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,450
So... so you can see this is how powerful it is and that all.
