00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,250
Hi Everyone, In this lecture we're going to talk about a general type of problem, which is known as coupon

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,090
collector problem.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,530
Let us understand this problem statement and this can be applied in question of this particular type. ok.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,059
Let's see this question.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,600
A certain brand distributes a coupon in a packet of chips.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,140
The coupon is chosen randomly from a set of N distinct coupons, so you have N type of coupons. let say

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:34,720
a coupon of type one, coupon of type two, up to a coupon of type N. and any packet of chips can contain

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,980
coupon with the value x.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,260
OK. I don't know what is this value x?

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,840
What is the expected number of packets that you will buy so that you get all the N distinct coupon?

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,290
So you want to collect all N distinct coupon?

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,200
And what is the number of packets you have to buy?

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,960
That is what you need to find out.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,340
OK.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:03,640
So another way to frame this question could be how many throws are needed so that you see all the N faces

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,810
of  a N sided die.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,140
OK?

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,500
How many throws are needed?

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,220
To get

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,610
all N faces

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:24,950
Of a N sided die. For example If the die has six sides. in how many throws you will see, all the faces from

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,030
one to six. that is another way of framing this particular problem.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,090
Let us discuss how we can solve this problem.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,450
What we will do? we will say okay. let us say that E(xi) denotes

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,630
the number of pockets you will buy, denotes the number of bags you will buy

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,480
To get.

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,390
to grab the ith new, the ith new coupon.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,300
ok, I'm not saying the ith coupon I am saying ith new coupon.

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,419
That means you have already collected I-1 type of coupon and now you're collecting the ith type

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,960
of coupon.

31
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,870
And what is the value that we want to compute?

32
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,150
We want to compute E(x).

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:23,450
That means we want to get all types of coupons which can be written as E(x1+x2+x3+...xn)

34
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,680
.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,230
This is what we want to compute and we have seen that using the rule of linearity of expectation.

36
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:39,410
This can be written as E(x1) plus E(x2) plus E(x3) and so on E(xn). all of these

37
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,930
terms can be added independently.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,040
Now we also saw that

39
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,850
getting a new coupon or getting an old coupon, so whenever this event is can be treated as a Bernoulli's trial,

40
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,590
ok so what is the probability of getting a new coupon ?so why it is a 

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,930
Bernoulli's trial, because if you buy a packet of chips, either you will get a new coupon.

42
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,580
That is a success.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:07,860
OK.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,570
Or you will get a coupon that you already have.

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,590
That means you will get the old coupon that is a state of failure.

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,820
What is the probability of getting the ith new coupon?

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,550
Probability of getting

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:29,740
the ith new open. let us try to find out this probability. so this would be how many new coupon are

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,220
available.

50
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,720
ok. that is available

51
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,380
new coupon after you have collected I-1 type of coupon upon total coupons. ok.

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,680
upon total coupon. as simple as that.

53
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,070
The probability of getting the ith new coupon is going to be nothing but let's say this probability

54
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,900
is equal to N minus

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,800
how many coupon would be available?

56
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,750
Suppose you have already collected

57
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:09,740
I-1 type of coupon OK. and total coupon is N. how many new type of coupon would be available

58
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,860
that would be nothing but N-i-1 

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,140
.

60
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:17,790
OK.

61
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:27,530
Upon total coupons that is N. so that means this probability P is nothing but n-i+1 upon N.

62
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,810
And then what is E(xi)?

63
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,440
Because

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,030
this is a case of a Bernoulli's trial.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,090
OK, so we can say this probability is nothing but one by P.

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,400
The number of pack that you will need to buy to get the ith new coupon is nothing but N upon

67
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,090
N-I +1.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,860
OK.

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,090
And what is the value that you want to compute?

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,800
You want to compute E(x) that is equal to E(x1).

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,000
So If you put the value of I is one what you get? you get N upon N-1+1.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,380
So you can clearly see that in order to get the first unique coupon, you only need to buy one pack.

73
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,370
ok at buying one back will give you the first new coupon.

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,890
OK, what about E(x2)?

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,310
So you will add this term to put the value of I as two.

76
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,540
It becomes N upon N minus two plus one, which is N-1. E(x3) that is N upon N-2

77
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,550
upon so on....

78
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,480
To get the Nth new coupon what it would be? you will say N divided by N-I,

79
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,290
which is N+1, so effectively you can clearly see if you have collected N-1

80
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:50,530
of coupons, then to get the Nth unique coupon the expected number of packs that you need to buy

81
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,160
is equal to N.

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,580
so that is what this series is.

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,730
So if you try to simplify this to what you will get is, you will get OK.

84
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:10,810
N upon N. so if you take the term N outside, it becomes... it becomes starting from this thing.

85
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,150
So I'm just going to write the terms.

86
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:20,950
In this order, it becomes one plus one by two plus one by three plus up to up to up to this term.

87
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,240
This term becomes one by N.

88
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,230
So this is the final result and this is... this would be your answer ok. For any given value of N

89
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,360
You can easily compute this.

90
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,620
series using a for loop and you can finally output your answer.

91
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,080
So I hope you have understood this problem.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,880
And that's all for this video.
