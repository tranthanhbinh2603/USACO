Hi Everyone, In this lecture will talk about Bernoulli's trial. so what is a Bernoulli's trial ? So an experiment

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,980
is called Bernoulli's trial if it has exactly two outcomes.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:20,590
For example, an experiment may end up in a success state or it may end up in a failure state.Exactly

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,950
two outcomes and out of which one is desired. for example, flipping a coin

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,480
Exactly

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,640
two outcomes. a head and tail.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,130
OK.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,110
Selecting a number from one to 100 to get the prime or not prime. So again

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,080
two outcomes prime or not prime.

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,350
Or rolling a die to get a four. So exactly two outcomes getting a four or getting a non four.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,070
OK?

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,830
So these all are examples of Bernoulli's trial and an experiment as a Bernoulli's trial

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,930
If the outcome can be represented using yes or no or a success failure kind of a state.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,290
This is what Bernoulli trial is in simple terms.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,570
And let's see at theorem that is associated with

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,340
Bernoulli's trial. If the probability of getting a success in Bernoulli's trial is P and the expected

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:16,010
number of trials to get success is one by P. effectively what we are saying is if we need it, If the probability

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,760
of success is P, then the number of trials we would need is one by P.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,230
Let us look at one example.

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,580
For example, what is the number of trials you would need to get a head?

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,870
OK.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,590
So the probability of getting a head is what ? if a fair coin is thrown it is one by two.

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:33,910
OK?

24
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,150
And what is the number of trials you would need to get a head?

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,010
So it would be nothing

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,190
But X would be equal to one by P.

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,770
so one upon

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,450
What is P ? It is 0.5.

29
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,840
.

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,370
So it is equal to two.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,150
So you can say in two throws you can expect a head.

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:53,690
OK.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,980
And what was the other method that we have already seen by making a simple equation so we can say we

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,010
can get. we can say x is the number of trials.

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,370
If you get head in the first throw itself, it is one by two into one. ok. Probability of getting a head

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,900
into number of throws.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,950
Or if we get a failure in the first throw. Ok. that would be one by two. getting.... getting a failure.

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,880
And how many throws we would need, it would be 1+x.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,100
So again, if you solve this equation, it is equal to 2x+1+1+x.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,790
This becomes X equal to two. again, using this method or if you use this method, you're getting the

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,480
same answer.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,800
So you can use either of these but this is more like a shortcut.

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:49,740
You can get the answer for events which are Bernoulli's trial in just one step.Ok. or otherwise you

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,430
can use the basic equation method that we have already discussed.

45
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,720
So this is Theorem one and Theorem two says the probability of getting success in a Bernoulli's trial is

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,080
P, then the expected number of successes

47
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,090
In N trial is N by P. OK.

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:17,370
For example, if you conduct multiple trials T1, T2 ,T3. Ok. T4  up to Tn. In any trial if

49
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,220
you are able to get success

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,830
With the probability of P then in N trial, how many successes you would have?

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,290
Again, it would be P P P, you're going to add all of them.

52
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,630
OK.

53
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,090
And this would be nothing but N multiplied with P.

54
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,280
So this is equal to NP. as simple as that. OK?

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,910
These are the two theorem that you should be knowing.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,380
And from the next video, we will solve one problem on Bernoulli's trial.
