Hi Everyone, so let us try to solve a problem using the rule of linearity of expectation.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,160
So let us go through this question.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,650
So it is a fair coin is true N times.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,010
What is the expected number of heads that you can get to get?

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,970
So let us consider this experiment of flipping a coin N times.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,590
And let us denote the outcomes of the experiment using this array.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,950
So the first experiment outcome is let say E1, the second experiment is E2,E3 and up

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,460
to up to En.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,060
So we want to calculate E(z).

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,750
That is nothing but E(e1)+E(e2)+E(e3)+

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,020
up to up to En. where E(i) what is E(i)?

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,840
So E(i) denote... it will take the value one if the ith experiment got the value head OK.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,300
In the ith experiment, if you got a head.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
This would be one or it would be zero if you got a failure.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,500
OK, let's see if you got a tail.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,260
So now what...

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:13,230
What we can say is that this can be written as E(e1)+E(e2)+E(e3)

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,220
And up to up to E(n). now we want to find out what is the value of E(ei)?

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,800
OK, what is the expected value of the ith experiment?

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,060
So we know that this can be written as Sigma xi nto pi, where Xi is the value that you got so Xi

21
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,480
is one.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,450
What is the probability of getting a head?

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,150
That is half.

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,570
What is the probability of getting a tail? that is also half.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,840
OK, so this comes out to be 0.5.

26
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,160
So what we can do is we can put each of these values as 0.5.

27
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,780
OK, so you are basically doing the summation of 0.5 how many times? N times.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,450
This becomes N  into 0.5.

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,740
And this is equal to N/2 and you can see that this is the probability.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,150
This is the probability of getting...

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,140
This is the expected number of heads.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,259
If you throw.... throw of... throw of fair coin N times.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,830
So basically it is half of them would be heads.

34
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,640
And that is also seems true

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,740
Logically, because of half the number of times you are, you can expect heads OK.

36
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,870
And I hope you understood this problem as well.

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,720
And that's all for this video.
