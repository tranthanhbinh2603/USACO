1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,490
OK, let us discuss this problem choose

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,650
Numbers. it says, N students are ask to choose a number from one to 100.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,310
OK.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,930
What is the expected number of students that would choose a single digit number?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,030
So let us talk about a single student.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,570
OK?

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,910
What is the probability of single student choosing a one digit number?

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,180
OK?

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,320
So between 1 to 100, we have only nine numbers so that means this probability would be 9/100.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,500
Now we are doing this experiment not for a single student.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,050
We are doing this experiment for N number of students, OK?

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,320
So if the probability of getting success in a single experiment has P OK. then we have seen from

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,130
theorem 2 that for N experiment or for N student.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,860
This is going to be N into P. OK.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,400
So we can see this is going to be 9P upon 100.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,290
And that's that's it.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,220
That's the answer.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,670
This is nothing but a simple application of Theorem two of Bernoulli's trial. that we have seen in the

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,930
concept video.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,530
OK?

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,700
So that's all.
