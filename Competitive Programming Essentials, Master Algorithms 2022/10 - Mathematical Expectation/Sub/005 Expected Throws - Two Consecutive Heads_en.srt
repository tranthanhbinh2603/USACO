Hi Everyone, so let us move on to the next problem statement.so we have seen what is the expected number

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,590
of throws to get a head.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,220
So in this question, we are slightly going to change the question. so the question is, what is the expected

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,720
number of throws that you would need to get two consecutive heads?

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,740
OK, so that means we want to get a head

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
Followed by a head again.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:33,140
Ok. so now what may happen is let us assume that our that is equal to x. the expected number of coin flip

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,950
is equal to X.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,960
Suppose you throw a coin once and you end up getting 
a head.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,720
Ok. so what would be the probability of getting a head one by two?

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,350
OK.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,580
And suppose you again throw a coin you again and get a head.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,430
So what would be this probability? one by two.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,750
So we actually throw a coin two times and suppose we got a head and again a head.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,120
That would be equal to one by two into one by two multiplied with two.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,070
What could be the other case?

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,280
Suppose on the first throw you get ahead.

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,980
On the second throw you get a tail.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,440
OK, so what would be this probability? Half.

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,680
And again, it would be half.

21
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:27,380
That means now you have wasted two throws and you again... you would require X number of more throws to

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,850
expect two more heads.

23
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,910
OK, so that means in total you would require x+2 t in throws this case.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,810
So it would be one by two into one by two into the number of throws that is equal to x+2.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,950
So what may happen in other case as well?

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,210
Suppose you throw a coin and you get a tail in the first throw.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,370
And in this case, what you will say? you will say. ok, I will try my experiment again and I will require

28
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,650
X number of more throws to get two heads. OK?

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,970
So in this case, you have wasted one throw.

30
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,510
OK.

31
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,240
So you can say one by two into X plus one. any other case?

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,790
No, we have already covered all the cases.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,910
So let's see how we can solve this equation.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,830
So it becomes X equals two.

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,940
This two goes off.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,860
It is equal to half plus one by four into X plus two into again.

37
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,020
Half into x plus one.

38
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:40,360
So let us multiply everything with four. it becomes 4x, it becomes four, it becomes four, and it

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,350
also becomes four.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,050
OK, so this becomes two. this goes off and this becomes two.

41
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,370
Let's expand.

42
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,720
So four x equals two plus x plus two plus 2x plus two.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,710
So effectively it becomes two plus two plus two six and this is x plus two x three x.

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,190
So four x minus three x is equal to six.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,230
That means X is equal to six.

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,550
OK, so that... this is how you can solve this equation.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,820
And what we are saying is we would... we can expect two consecutive heads if we throw a coin six times.

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,320
OK?

49
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,290
So I hope you understood this problem as well and see you in the next video.
