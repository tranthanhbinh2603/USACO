Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,440
So now we are going to look at how we can clear the ith bit. OK.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,610
So basically if we have a number like. let's say, one one zero one and I want to delete this bit

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,090
and I want to make it zero. OK. I want to clear the ith bit, so I is two for this example.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,160
Let's say. what I need to do.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,380
I need to create a number in which only this bit is zero.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:37,250
Only this bit is zero and rest everything else is going to be one, so I need this as zero and rest

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,140
everything is one.

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,820
can you guess how we can get this particular kind of a number, OK?

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,980
The one thing we know is the ith... we want to work on the ith bit. so we can create a mask using one left shift i.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,230
.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,270
It will give us something like this zero one zero zero.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,860
OK ? that is fine.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,930
And how do we get this number?

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,940
It is nothing but it's a...

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,580
It's a NOT of this number. So bitwise why NOT.

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,480
So what we need to do we need to do a negation here and we once we are getting this, what we can

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
do ? we can do AND.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,720
if we do a AND all these bits will be reserved so we will get one zero one.

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,400
And since we have a zero here, zero and something it is going to again zero.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,110
So that's it.

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,740
So this is going to clear the ith bit.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,100
So if I show you the mask now, the mak is going to be nothing but NOT of one left shift i.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,690
And what you need to do? you need to update the value of n so you need to say n equals to n AND mask.

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,320
and we are done. Instead of calling setIthbit

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm going to call clearithbit.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,820
I give N and I.

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,000
And let us clear the...

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,120
So this number is what?

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,020
One two four eight.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,230
This is this number is 13.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,860
So if I say, let's say n is 13 and I want to clear the second bit.

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,340
If n is 13 and I want to clear the second bit.

34
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,450
I should get a number which is nine. zero one two.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,870
Yes.

36
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,730
So let's see.

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,850
I want to clear the second bit.

38
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,480
OK, I need to run this code, build this code first.

39
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,330
If i clear the second bit.

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm getting the output which is exactly equal to nine.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,050
OK.

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:42,550
So I hope this is clear to you and this is how we can clear any bit in a number.
