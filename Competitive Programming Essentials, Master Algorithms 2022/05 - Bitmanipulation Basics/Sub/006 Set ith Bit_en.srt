00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,870
Hi Everyone, the next thing that we're going to look at is how do we set ith bit. Ok. we need to write a

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,410
function.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,770
void set i th bit and we get the number and we get the position.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,660
So one thing you can do is you can take this number by reference and you can change the value

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,240
here or you can return the new number. OK?

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,680
So maybe another way to make this function is like this.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,040
OK.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,310
And here you have to return the new value.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:37,050
So maybe I want to go with the first one because we we want to change the value of n in the function

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,470
itself.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,440
So let's see how we can do it.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,410
So it's actually very easy, very similar to what we have seen in the get, let's say the number is five.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,620
And I want to say the first bit.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,250
OK.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,700
I want to set the first bit.

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,010
that is this one.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,540
OK, so what I need, I need to do OR operation, a bitwise OR with the number which looks like this.

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,500
zero one zero. which has set bit at the i th index.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,250
OK.

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,820
And i th bit should be set. so what we need to do? we need to create a mask that is again, this

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,800
number is going to be one left shift i.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,360
I will get this number.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,250
And we will do a Bitwise OR with the value of n.

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:30,830
And so let's see, so we can say int mask equals one left shift i.

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,170
And what we can say? we can say,

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,830
Let's update the value of N as N OR mask.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,690
And we are done.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:49,790
Now, if the number is five if I say, OK. get ith bit. OK. I can say void, I can say set

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,810
ith bit.

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,040
Instead of calling this I can call set ith bit.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,110
I give the value of n and i and maybe I print the new value of n.

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,470
And so let's try to run this.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,310
I say. OK, I us set the first bit so you can see after setting the first bit the result is seven.

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,000
which is fine. if I set the zero th bit then the result will not change because that bit is already

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,720
set in five.

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,290
So that's all.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,260
That's how it is going to work.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,280
So we are getting this number one one one by setting the i th bit as one.

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,690
That's it.

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,980
See you in the next lecture.
