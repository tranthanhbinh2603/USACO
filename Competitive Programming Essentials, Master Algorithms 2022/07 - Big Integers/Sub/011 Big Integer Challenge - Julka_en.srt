00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,620
Hi Everyone. in this lecture, we're going to solve a challenge from the online platform that is a SPOJ.

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,260
And it's a very simple problem that deals with big integer operations.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,970
So let us look at the problem statement and then we will try to solve it.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,440
OK. so let's say. so the Julka is given by her teacher is the very simple puzzle.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,050
There are two friends and they have 10 apples together.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,440
OK.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,070
And

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,870
one of the girls has two more apples than the other girl.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,730
How many apples they have?

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,530
OK. so this is a simple example.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,270
The actual question is here.

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,650
Let us first look at the example, then we will look at the problem. In the example it is given ok 

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,140
one girl has

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,920
apple x, another girl has y number of apples.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,320
The sum of the apples is 10.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,330
That is X plus y it is 10 and the other girl has two more apples

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,500
then the first girl. So y is having X plus 2 apples.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,740
So if effectively you can say. OK. Y it's nothing but x plus two so x plus x plus two.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,820
This is 10.

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,780
That means 2X is equal to 10 minus two. eight.

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,260
It means X is nothing but eight by two

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,750
that is four. the value of X is four.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,640
And what is the value of Y?

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,470
That is X plus two that is 10.

25
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,160
So you can see this is the number of apples the first girl has.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,380
This is a number of apples the second girl has.

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,080
Now the question is let us make the problem a little more difficult instead of saying they have 10 apples,

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,020
so the teacher is trying to check that

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,280
If it increases the value of some of apples then whether they can solve it correctly or not. ok.

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,280
the teacher wants to continue asking the question but with big numbers. OK. so help the teacher to write

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,220
a program which will tell her the right answers. so what we are given?

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,940
So we are given

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,710
that X plus Y is now not 10 but it's a big number. OK?

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,990
And it is also given that the second girl has instead of having... ok.

35
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,670
So it is given that the second goal is having K more apples than the first girl.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,130
OK, so if you go through the problem statement, you will get to know. In the input you're given

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,230
every test case consist of two lines.

38
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,050
The first says how many apples both the girls have.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:41,220
The second line is how many more apples the second girls. OK and both are the positive integers and the value

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,010
of the integer is of the order 10 power 100.

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,220
But that means you cannot fit this number inside the regular integer.

42
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,130
you need a big integer. ok.

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,350
So every test case should output two lines. and first should contain the number of apples belonging to

44
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,320
the first girl. second should contain the number of apples belonging to the second girl.

45
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,780
All right, so this is what we have.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,660
So let's see how we can approach this question now.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,740
So if I say, it is given that OK. let us assume the first girl has x apples.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,610
The second girl has Y number of apples.

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,070
It is given X plus y is what? X plus Y is what?

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,490
It's a big integer N. OK. and it is also given that Y is K more than X.

51
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,140
OK, so I can say x plus x plus k.

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,570
This is equal to N OK.

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,670
That means 2X plus K is equal to N.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,390
And N and K is input. ok. the input is given. input is N and K.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,940
And in the output, we need to find the values of X and Y. so we can simply say X is nothing but N minus

56
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,750
K by two.

57
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,950
All right.

58
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,780
And what would be the value of a Y. Y is nothing but x plus K.

59
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,500
OK.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,140
So using this formula, we can find out values of both X and Y.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,140
And what I would suggest is you try to write a program on your own, which works with big integers.

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,589
OK.

63
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,320
So what is what we are doing here?

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,940
We are doing a subtraction.

65
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,500
If you use Java, you can use the subtract method on the big integer object.

66
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,100
OK.

67
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,310
And here you are also doing a division, so you can use the divide method.

68
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,760
OK.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,970
And one thing you need to notice if N and K are big integers then you can easily do subtraction.

70
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,980
But this two is an integer

71
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,760
So maybe you have to convert this to into a big integer object and then you have to divide it with two.

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,070
Okay. so you can say something like OK. let's create a big integer using this two.

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,820
Something like this.

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,990
So we will see in the next video, how you can write the code.

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,110
And this is what? this is nothing but addition operation.

76
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,840
You're again adding a big integer X with a big integer K. and you are done.

77
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,950
OK, so let's see the code in the next lecture.

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,000
But before that, I want you to try this problem on your own and try to submit it on SPOJ in Java.

79
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,340
OK?

80
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,340
That's all.

81
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,500
See you in the next video.
