00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:07,020
Hi Everyone, so let us move on to the next problem that is about computing a large factorial. ok.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,260
So in this problem we are given

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,810
integer.so the input is not a big integer.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,630
It would be a a normal integer but the output that we want to produce that is the factorial of this

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,400
particular number.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,370
It may be very large and may not fit inside into integer. for example, 100 factorial. OK.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,900
So this is the value of hundred factorial and you see it is a very large. it cannot fit into a long

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,580
long or something like that.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:31,910
OK.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,040
So what we need is, we need to look how we can do multiplication.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,490
OK?

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:46,250
And again we need to come up with an algorithm for multiplication and we will store all these digits

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,730
inside a array.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,290
ok. we will use a array.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,380
Each index of the array will store one digit and let's see how we can build this particular output.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,710
So first of all, we need to know what a factorial is. so if you want to compute five factorial then it

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,790
does nothing but five multiplied by four factorial. ok. what we will do? we will compute the answer to this

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,600
particular point.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,940
Again, using repeated multiplication. and let us say this answer is 24 and will multiply this with

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,340
five.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:26,660
What we need is, we need this again would be computed  multiplying one into two, the into into three this into four.

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,020
So we need to see how we can perform multiplication between two numbers.

23
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,610
So let's say we have a larger number on this side, a smaller number on this side.

24
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,940
So first of all we'll write this. OK.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,200
The pen and paper method. how how we do it. we say OK.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,180
Five multiplied by four is 20.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,140
we say 2 carry. 5 into 2 is ten.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,270
plus 2 is 12. we put two and we put one carry

29
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,270
and this one will come here. OK?

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,930
so this answer is 120.

31
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,510
Again you can see we are building this in the right to left order

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,360
but since we are storing this inside a area. the array can be built in the left to right order. ok. the array should

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,610
be build in a left to right order. because in an array we have vacant space on the right.

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,860
So any additional digit like this one

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,740
they can be easily accommodated on the right side.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:27,070
so What we will do? we will reverse this number. we will reverse this. we will write four and two here and we will multiply that with

37
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,490
five.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,880
OK.

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,300
And let's see this output is being stored inside a array.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,590
Ok. we we have a large array here.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,480
we say five into four.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,670
That is 20.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,530
So we'll multiply this number with this digit. so five into four is 20. we have

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:52,590
this number. We extract this digit by doing. OK, whatever the product mod 10 that would be stored here.

45
00:02:52,770 --> 00:03:01,040
So zero comes here and two gets carry. two gets carried  of. five into two is 10. 10 plus carry 

46
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,460
that is equal to 12.

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,130
so what we do? we put two here and whatever is left, it gets carried of.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,640
And since we don't have anything here this Kerry would be put here.

49
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,790
So you can see this answer is also 120.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,850
The only thing is you need to reverse the array to read this answer. So if you reverse it, you get 120

51
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,350
as the answer.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,630
OK?

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,420
So let us look at one more example of doing multiplication.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,230
OK, so let's say

55
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,590
the number is 922. OK and we want to multiply it with 15.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
So how we're going to do it? Now in this case, you have a bigger number here.

57
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,040
It's not one digit it's two digit.

58
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,720
So let me tell you, how we're going to multiply this number.

59
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,650
So we have 922, which is again an integer.

60
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,620
So we reverse this.

61
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,510
It becomes 229. OK and we have 15 here. OK?

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,490
And we are going to do multiplication.

63
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,590
So in this case, I've only reversed this number and not reversed this number.

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,360
This number is as it is.

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,160
So we'll multiply.

66
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,410
This digit. ok. This digit.

67
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,600
so this is inside a array because the result of multiplication is going to be large.

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,480
So this is going to be kept inside a array.

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,380
OK.

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
This could be a bigger number as well.

71
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,730
And the result would be stored here.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,180
OK.

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
The result would be stored here.

74
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,240
Now

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,850
because when you're doing something like this. one  two two into three into four into five into

76
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:49,730
six into seven into into, let's say 15 or whatever, then this result would be very big.

77
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,010
but this number would be small.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,340
So this we will store inside a array.

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,950
and this we will store this inside a int.

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,290
OK. so this is what it is.

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,820
So 15 into two. 

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:12,450
It is what? it is 13. we put zero. three gets carried of. 15 into two is 30. 30 plus 3 is 33.

83
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,210
We have three. three gets carried of. 15 into nine is what?

84
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,190
135. so what

85
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,300
we have? 135 plus the carry

86
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,710
That is 138.

87
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,230
OK, what we put here? we put 8 here and what's

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,080
gets carried of.

89
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,040
13 gets carried of.

90
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,390
OK.

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,770
13

92
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,490
get carried of.

93
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,740
So how do we accommodate 13?

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,150
We say OK. while this number is not

95
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,150
zero.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,690
We extract one digit out of it.

97
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,160
We put that digit here and we reduce it by a factor of 10.

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,420
OK. so this number now becomes one. extract the last digit put it here and we reduce it by a factor

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,870
of 10.

100
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,430
So this becomes zero.

101
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,370
so the final answer that we are able to look at is we are going to reverse this.

102
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,420
OK?

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,990
And after reversing this, we will see it as nothing but one three eight three zero.

104
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,400
OK.

105
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,230
I have a terminal shall open.

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,260
So one three eight one three zero.

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,120
This is the output.

108
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:22,660
OK.

109
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:33,670
If I show you the multiplication here. so 922 if I do 922 into 15, it is giving me an answer

110
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,420
of one three eight three zero which is same as this one.

111
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,360
So this output would be stored inside a array.

112
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,690
OK.

113
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,570
This concept of multiplication explains how you can multiply a large number which is stored inside a array  

114
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,490
with a particular integer.

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,620
And we are going to use this concept to compute factorial of a number.

116
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,180
Ok. so all we would need is, we will need is to

117
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:10,010
OK. so what we will need is, we will need to write a method that multiplies array with a particular number.

118
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,260
OK?

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,250
So if we have this method, multiply

120
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,870
an array with a particular number then very easily we can calculate our factorial by reading a

121
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,540
loop for I equal to one, I less than equal to N, I++. whatever array you have

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,500
you multiply it with that particular I.

123
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,010
OK.

124
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:40,660
And yes, this is how we're going to compute the factorial. so let's see the code in the next lecture.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
And that's all.
