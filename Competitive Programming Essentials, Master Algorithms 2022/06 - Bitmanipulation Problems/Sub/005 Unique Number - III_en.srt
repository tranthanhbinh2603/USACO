00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,230
Hi everyone. In this lecture we're going to solve this problem, unique number 3N+1.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,660
okay, so this bit different from the problems that we have seen where the repeating numbers were

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,740
coming two times but in this problem, the number that is repeating is coming tries except one number,

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,390
which is coming only once.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:21,660
OK?

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,270
So let us look at an example.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:34,700
Now, this example is let's say we have the numbers five, two, five and let's say three five

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,360
Two and two. so you can see the number five

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,720
is coming three times.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,170
Ok and the number two is also coming three times, the one unique number is nothing but 3.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,600
The problem is... although we can do it using the frequency table but we need to think in terms of

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,200
bits, OK?

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,180
So the idea here is.

14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,500
We somehow can we do XOR. the answer is No.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,950
Ok, if you do sort of let's to five or five sort of five.

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,280
It will still give you the result 5 ok. so what... what you need is you need a way

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,520
so that you can

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,840
Cancel out

19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,190
bits of repeating numbers. ok., a bit of a repeating numbers, OK?

20
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,970
Basically instead of a number when it is coming three times the bits should get cancelled for that

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,730
particular number.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,060
OK, so how we can do it so let's come up with an approach.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,280
OK, so what we will do?

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,270
We will now look at some of bits on each bit position.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,500
ok. why this is important.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,870
You will come to know very soon.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,660
Let me just first write down all the numbers in in a single line.

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,530
OK?

29
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,640
In a single column. let say the number is what? the number is

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,190
Five. okay.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,930
And I'm going to make three bit position ok. one

32
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,680
two two and three.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,840
right now, I just assuming the numbers are small but otherwise we will have 32 bit positions.

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,470
OK, if it is a integer then five is nothing but one zero one.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,910
What about two?

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,650
two is nothing but zero one zero.

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,780
What about five?

38
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,190
again One zero one.

39
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,790
What about three ? zero one one.

40
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,260
What about five?

41
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,280
One zero one. what about two? zero one zero.

42
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,200
What about two zero one?

43
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,190
You get what I'm saying is we'll find out.

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,840
The some will find out the sum along each column along each column.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,620
Let's see what is this?

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,340
The sum for this is one, two, three and four.

47
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,210
OK, what about this sum for this one, two, three and four?

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,650
OK.

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,540
What about this one?

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,010
The what I'm saying is that some.

51
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,750
At each position, OK, some at each position.

52
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,420
Will be on the phone, Ryan, or it will be of the endless fun, OK?

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,650
So it will be three in four for the column.

54
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,940
We're the unique no does not have us.

55
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,620
OK, so it will be three.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,580
And if?

57
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,650
Unique, no.

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,180
Does not.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,190
I was say, OK, does not have a certain.

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,150
And you can verify for this calamitous.

61
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,180
It is three days of the farm train.

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,940
And here you can see the unique number that is three.

63
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,820
It does not have a set built in this column, so you see to see one and see zero.

64
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,170
OK.

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,510
And it will be on the phone to the endless one, we're unique, no, has I said.

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,240
OK, unique number has a Edward because every other number is coming three times, OK, it this tree

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,500
and will always be there.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,630
And this one bit would be added because of the unique number, and it has led to celebrate here and

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:30,870
it.

70
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,750
And you can see the summit of the farm tree and plus one look at the summit of the palm tree and plus

71
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,050
one.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,370
What are you going to do, what each of these positions you can do or more with three you get whether

73
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,410
the original as zero or one.

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,770
So if you do a morbidity, you will get three more three.

75
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,590
That is what, zero or more?

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,240
Three that is one or more.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,010
Three, that is one.

78
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,920
OK, so now you are getting three words, OK, and now you get the binary representation of the unique

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,260
number.

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,510
So if you convert this into decimal zero multiplied with two squared plus one multiplied by two rows

81
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,080
to divide one plus one multiplied with to register to the bar zero.

82
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,360
This number is what this number is.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,850
Nothing but the number three itself.

84
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,150
OK?

85
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,480
And this is how you can actually find the unique numbers OK.

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,050
And you can extend this approach for maybe numbers of the Form five and +1 or seven plus one or four

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,130
and plus one, whatever.

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,230
And this approach can.

89
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,540
This resolution can be extended for those kind of numbers as we looking.

90
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,290
So I hope you really understood the solution.

91
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:51,390
OK, so Warren, Glusman, you you can simply do this odd think for five and +1 because it is all you

92
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,630
can use this kind of approach as well.

93
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:01,680
OK, so I have no showing you the most common approaches for solving these unique number type of problems.

94
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,940
And in the next lecture, healthy the code for this particular approach.

95
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,870
That's all for this video.

96
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,370
Thank you.
