1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,760
So let's see the code for the problem unique number one.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,880
OK, so what we're going to do? we are going to make a method int unique number.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:20,370
And we can either pass a array or vector to this method and will return the unique number.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,840
Okay. so n is going to be array.size() .

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,060
And here let's create a array, So vector of integers array.

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,250
And I give the numbers let's say one, three, five or

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,380
Three, five, three one five ok. the unique number is four

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,120
That's what we want to figure it out.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,550
I will say, ok. cout unique number and I give the array.

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,590
So we discussed the concept is very simple so I can say, OK, I'll find out the cumulative XOR of

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,340
all the numbers.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,110
Let's say the XOR is zero, for int i equal to zero.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,230
I less then n.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,849
I + +.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:14,500
I can see cumulative XOR plus equals. sorry... equals cumulative XOR with the current numbers the

16
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,840
the current number is array of i.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,700
That's it.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,000
And once we're done with this, we can return the cumulative XOR.

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,590
And this XOR will store the unique number.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,000
So let's build the code.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,780
And we should include vector as well.

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,150
And you can see the code is built.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,220
And if you now run this dot slash unique one, we're getting the unique number as four.

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,910
That means our code is working perfectly fine.

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,950
So that's all for this video.

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,090
See you in the next lecture.
