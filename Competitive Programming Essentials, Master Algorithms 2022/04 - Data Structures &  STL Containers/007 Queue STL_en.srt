Hi Everyone in this lecture, I'm going to tell you about the queue STL, the queue standard template library,

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,600
so that is present, the queue class is present in the file hash include queue.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,680
So you have to include this and once you include this.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,160
You can easily make a queue of any datatype.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,190
Let's say queue of integers, and we will just try to insert some numbers in the queue so 

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,360
queue dot push lets say one.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,210
And.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Maybe two.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,880
Then three, then four, then five and then six.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,480
So what we will do will try to print the entire element of the queue and we will remove everything from

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,490
the front so while the queue is not empty, so we will do cout queue dot front.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,550
So the STL also provides this method and we can do queue dot pop

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,960
But OK, that's it.

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,030
And this is how we can use the inbuilt C++ standard template library, queue.

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,690
And now we can actually try to run over code as well.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,040
So.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,630
Let me show you.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,060
We are getting the output in the same order that means it is a fifo kind of a queue.

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,630
All right.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,870
So that's all for this lecture.

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,400
Thank you.
