1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey, welcome everyone.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:02,910
And.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,650
In this part, what we'll do is we'll try and code this problem that we discussed and we discussed it

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,180
for the first three frames.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:12,930
And.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,620
508 as a number, and but now what we'll do is we'll try and call this problem for them, and we sure

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,330
will fill out.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,800
And let's call it.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,320
OK, let's take this as an important.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,470
Eight.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,210
And let's take the first and prime numbers.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:33,930
Eight.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm just taking them and then we'll discuss how do we call this out, how do we make individual elements

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,240
out of them and take their seems right?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,900
So it's not necessarily the daily claims you can pick any of those numbers, right?

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:53,980
But do remember when you're considering their Elysium's, then you will have to divide by their new

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,430
series.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,860
OK, so just remember this part.

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm just taking planes, so they're in a team.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,820
I just multiply all of them and not divide anything in their.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,350
You know, communities will find the ultimate.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,190
One of the first frames are two three five seven.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,900
Eleven.

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,420
Thirteen.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,750
There.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,020
I don't know, my calculations have become very big after I completed my bachelors.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,130
It was good.

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,920
Does everything right so.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,580
I've stopped using mine.

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,420
Yeah.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,950
These are the primes.

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,460
The first eight frames made.

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,350
So we want to take 10.

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,610
Let's take 10 or 23 is a prime number, according to me.

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,130
And 29 is a premium, but then eight.

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,660
So what I need to do is I have to make all types of sex now, right?

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,880
So how do I make all types of sex?

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,170
We have already gone through the manipulation section.

39
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,630
If not, there's a big manipulation section in this code.

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,030
You can go through it.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
So how do I make all this sets?

42
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,020
Let's say I have three numbers A, B and C, and I want to make all possible sets of these three.

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,610
Then what do I do?

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,970
Just.

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,950
Quickly going through it said zero means not including anyone.

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,760
OK, let's write binary of zero eight.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,080
So I have three elements that means I'll start from zero and go to the two to the bar with three, minus

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,560
four and eight.

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,820
How many elements are there from zero to seven included?

50
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,350
We have to delete elements.

51
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,810
Eight These eight elements that actually the number of sets we can make from A B and C I have zero one

52
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,800
two three four five six seven eight nine the binary zero zero zero.

53
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,940
This is one's binary.

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,530
It was binary.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,510
These binary or.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,960
Five.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,920
Six and seven eight.

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,430
That means at the time when we have one will simply consider that eliminate the Indy rules by Indy,

59
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,560
there is no one that means it's an empty suit.

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,700
Here we can't see to see here we consider be here.

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,970
We consider B and C because B and C rate B and C are we are getting this.

62
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,360
So now here we consider e who we consider AC, a b and a B and C.

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,880
So here you can see I was able to derive all these sets using some bit manipulation.

64
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,150
If I just iterate from zero to two to the power and minus one, then I'll have to roll to the debout

65
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,380
end numbers later.

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,200
How many total sets we have to retrieve our end sets?

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,220
All those numbers can help us generate all these sets.

68
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,240
In theory of an element.

69
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,950
So this is what is already described to you and just quickly revising it.

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,270
They will generate all sorts of these fame numbers.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,040
Right.

72
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,480
Yeah.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:09,030
OK, so as I said, ill, which number do we have to go, we have to go still to do the power in minus

74
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,120
one day, so we just simply left shift one endings and will simply get rid of the power and they and

75
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,430
we are moving less than that.

76
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,630
That means so I'm starting from zero so that you don't get confused because zero is actually not needed

77
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,880
here, but still no problem with it.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,130
And.

79
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,860
If I take a Pfizer, which is zero, that means how many elements are you using to buy that?

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,160
So there isn't any eliminate.

81
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,900
What else to do is I'll simply start with one.

82
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,940
So let's start with one and let's try and make all the possible subsets first.

83
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:42,810
Well.

84
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,510
Let's call it in its May Day Go, Darling.

85
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,940
So if the jet a bit of elite element is said liquidated.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,710
Then included.

87
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,810
That's what we did.

88
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,580
So how how will it check if the G8, the bit of ice element is certainly or not?

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,170
I'll just regift idea names and end with one.

90
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,440
If this is true, that means the G8, the weight of eight elements that if it is said, I would simply

91
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,330
sit out right now, I'm just printing it so that it's very clear to all of us.

92
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,160
I read and it said they'd.

93
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,950
OK, OK, sorry.

94
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,480
And is the total.

95
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,060
And is the number in which we are going to find a date or we just have to find these subsets of this

96
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,660
primes?

97
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,980
Victor, let's take em as prime start place.

98
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,000
Very sorry.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,630
Sorry for that.

100
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,100
Yeah, let's take em here, Norton in.

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
And so Mr.

102
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,340
Right.

103
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,220
And we'll simply say, Scott Primes do.

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,380
Well, after this and I simply.

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,620
Brent.

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,470
Now you can see that we are generating all subsets in two three two three five two five.

107
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,100
We have three also, we have four also there.

108
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,190
And if I just keep on going down, we will see many more.

109
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,140
To the and this is the last one, I guess, which contains.

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,240
All the elements in disarray to how many are there 1023 eight?

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,740
If I have 1200, that means which one have I not included?

112
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,610
I have not included.

113
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,630
Zero zero.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,290
I'm always so.

115
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:47,860
OK.

116
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,690
I think I just changed my.

117
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,420
Notifying.

118
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,240
OK, so this way we can just generate all the possible subsets of.

119
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,460
Ms.

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,870
Now what I what I need to do is instead of printing them, I just have to find their LC ms rate.

121
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,160
So let me again be recalled, Tim.

122
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
Let me get equal to one.

123
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,420
And whenever I'm finding any number eight, whenever I get a number, what will I do?

124
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,380
Let me.

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,790
Well, so whenever I'm.

126
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,750
When I including a number in my state, let's just multiply them because I've considered only prime

127
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,460
numbers and I don't have divided loyalties, I say Altium in two equals two this times.

128
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,190
Yeah.

129
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,260
So if that bit is said, the wins included prime number include means just multiplied into the.

130
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,560
And now what we'll do is we'll have a.

131
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,740
Final answer.

132
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,300
That means how many of them were actually included?

133
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,320
How many do.

134
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,550
How many so.

135
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,240
I do I do this.

136
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,090
It's very simple.

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
If the.

138
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,740
If the number of OK, just give me.

139
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry for that.

140
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:16,470
Now, what we have to see is that if the number of elements included, but.

141
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,280
Even then, subtract them or if they were all at them.

142
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,070
So there's dysfunction we all know about this, which is building popcorn trade, so.

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,620
Yeah, built, built in.

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,309
Funk, what does this do?

145
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,730
I just I just pass into it, and this will tell me what is the total number of Dead Birds in eight eight?

146
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:50,840
If the number of said Virginia is even that means it is doable by two, then employee excluded.

147
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,870
They'd want to exclude anybody else, him it is in and is the number we'll provide, let's provide a

148
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,100
very big number right now.

149
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,110
Where does Elysium, which is nothing but the multiplications of all the primes and.

150
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,590
Biomass objecting because there isn't even said that which contains even number of frames and other

151
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,520
ways, I simply add it into my LTM the odd frames.

152
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,750
Well, and after this is done, there's nothing much left.

153
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,490
So we'll just see out answer.

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,150
So there are these many numbers, which are lives in the first ten frames, which are less than this

155
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,580
particular in data, literally 200.

156
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,770
Let's take if it works or not.

157
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,510
It before and if I do 10.

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,570
So there are total nine numbers which are usually by the first in primes.

159
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,140
What is the number which is left?

160
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,030
It is when one is not used by any of these great.

161
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,420
Filled in, so I hope this court is very clear to you all, we didn't do much, we just calculated all

162
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:02,720
the.

163
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,680
Upsets and welcome greetings, absurd, we just checked that.

164
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,460
We just found out the him if the number of elements in the set was even suppressed them, because that's

165
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,420
what we noticed, right?

166
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,260
That's what we noticed if you went to break them, if it's ordered them into one.

167
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:30,130
So as we can see here and missed any rate, what if and was more it, what if 31 was also here?

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,150
Admits and was equal to 11.

169
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,290
But this this particular court work, according to the 11th IT subset, it will generate all possible

170
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,430
subsets of these 11 prime numbers and add and subtract accordingly.

171
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,540
So this is where computers help us aid and towards the complexity of the code.

172
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,400
So this particular for loop goes straight to the the program, which is in the middle of crimes.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,290
It has 11 brains are destroyed, about 11 in 211.

174
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,130
It just goes to land only.

175
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,500
And this is nothing we're just checking and this is alternating just over.

176
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,710
Brilliant.

177
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,130
So we have some brilliant popcorn functions if you do not know about them.

178
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,570
You can refer to the brain manipulation section in this particular course or by searching for them online.

179
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,400
So just find out some building functions, which comes very handy during the contest.

180
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,860
Otherwise, you'll have to make another function parsing data to check the number of.

181
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,170
Which certainly state just.

182
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,960
Move ahead and find some interesting building functions in C++.

183
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,690
Well, so that said, guys, in the next part, I hope you understood how it is.

184
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,620
Inclusion Exclusion Bug eight.

185
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,210
Next part will be a little advance in which I'll be explaining what is Mobius function in number 30,

186
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,430
which is all to use for inclusion exclusion.

187
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,960
But that's very advanced.

188
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,020
So just get your hands on this practice few problems regarding inclusion, exclusion and then move ahead.

189
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,980
Thank you.
