00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,010
Everyone, welcome to this lecture of inclusion exclusion.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,390
And in this lecture, we'll see how inclusion and exclusion problems can be solved in code forces.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,960
And we will see that what different types of problems are there?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,340
Right.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,120
And we will also see it.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,030
Why is Ford required, right?

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,800
So that's the most important part.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,470
The device will actually be a whole lot of coding, a whole lot of word manipulation be required and

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,580
inclusion exclusion.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,360
Well, let me start with a very simple division.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,720
You all must have gone through the gone through discrete mathematics or simple mathematics, and we

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,640
know we have said to iterate.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:52,580
Well, we know there's activity and to it, we know we have some things they said contained some elements

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,910
in them.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,240
So let's say I have a city with some numbers in it.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,810
And let me just give some random numbers to it.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,760
Well.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,390
I have a said to be looking again, give a very random numbers to this.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,030
Well, so that means I have to search here, which is a and B and as the name suggest inclusion and

20
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,290
exclusion, that means I think Louis fields few of the things and I wouldn't exclude for few of the.

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:33,160
So I'm taking a very simple example of usage rate and it's just a quick revision rates.

22
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,540
And then we will keep on increasing the number of search and see how actually it works.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,620
And then we look at some very nice examples and then we'll call them full.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,700
So if I were to find out what is a Union B, that means.

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,840
And with the number of OK, not the number of elements, let's take this set.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,350
OK.

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,350
The suits, which are in both A and B, the numbers which are both in B and how do I find this?

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,440
So we all know this, it is equal to air.

29
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,730
I'm just writing this eight names plus b minus e.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,590
Intersection B eight.

31
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,970
What does this mean?

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,830
How does this work?

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,170
We all know, we all know this is very simple.

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,050
Let's say the society is said to be so.

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,970
Right now, a vital thing that means I've included all the elements in there.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Eight wild thing be that means I've included all the elements in there to include all the elements in

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:35,890
be.

38
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,030
And if I include all the elements in A and B to what are the elements here, we have one three, five,

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,080
10, 50 and two for five in a hundred and forty.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,060
It will be all this.

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,660
That or does a certain set does not contain some identical elements to all the elements and said are

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,450
distinct, so no duplicate elements are there and separate.

43
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,360
But here we can see if I do it.

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,120
Blessed be that means if I join and B into one set, what will I get?

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,500
I'll get some duplicate elements.

46
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,000
What are those elements to name them?

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,150
We can have five five babies two times, also 10.

48
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,650
Any of the two names, eight and two for fifty one party and 100 great known elements has a good race

49
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:24,830
here.

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,430
Eight.

51
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,500
What is firing down here, firing and not actually into Section B?

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,550
That means.

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:40,070
I have included the elements which are common to what E and B twice late, so if I want to remove those

54
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,000
elements, what will I do?

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,020
What will I do?

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,120
I simply remove intersection B elements one number of times it just one day not.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,830
I'm not saying remove them twice.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,940
I'm just saying remove them once fired because they have been counted here.

59
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,520
Grace Barnini and one Inbee who just moved them once and will get all the elements.

60
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,890
What is a intersection B two intersection B in this case, as we can see, the common elements in both

61
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:14,520
N.B. and those elements are five and an eight intersection B Harris and in five, basically.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,130
And if I remove an invite from this set, it means I'm doing a minus intersection B.

63
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,340
Never will I get I'll get this particular.

64
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,450
That but this side is equal to a union.

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,840
I hope this is very clear, it's very simple, and we have already started this fight, so this part

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,850
is a Union B.

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,680
As you can see, no element has been counted.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,780
Why is it?

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,660
And if I want to find out the number of elements in the liver I can do is I can see number of elements

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,910
in a union very close to a number of elements in there, plus number of elements in B minus number of

71
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,410
elements in a intersection.

72
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,540
B, The how much will this be?

73
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,520
How many elements that are in there in their file?

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,620
Plus how many elements in B?

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,900
We have one two three four five six elements.

76
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,880
And how many common elements to sue?

77
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,550
What is the total number of elements here?

78
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,270
Nine.

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,360
So we have nine elements in a Union B.

80
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,030
I hope you got this part.

81
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,810
Eight.

82
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,150
It's a very, very simple example.

83
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,280
Very easy to understand.

84
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,110
Eight.

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,300
Now, let's move on to a slightly different example.

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,270
What if there are three sets, eight and one, for example?

87
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,130
I would like to take up a problem.

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,190
Let's do that in the next part.

89
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,500
OK?

90
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's meet in the next few.
