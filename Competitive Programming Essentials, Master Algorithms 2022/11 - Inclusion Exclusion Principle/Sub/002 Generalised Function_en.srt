00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,540
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,780
So let's generalize all of it to in the previous video we saw, how does it go for two point and we

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,230
saw that in the audience and I just, you know, coming up really quick before the reset, how does

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,730
it happen?

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,610
How does it work?

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,500
It's very simple.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,470
It's ABC.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,670
I've already done them and we know what is a common be a intersection C and B intersection C.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,910
Right now we have a third thing, which is intersection B, intersection C, which is common to all

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,710
three A, B and C eight.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,830
For example, let's take the below example, which is numbers which are less than 15 and divisible by

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,100
two.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,720
So we can see those are two four six eight, 10, 12, 14 eight.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,940
And what is B numbers, which are less than 15 and diesel by the late?

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,040
Finally, we have numbers of what you see, which is Diesel five, which is five, 10, 15.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,320
So I'm seeing less than or less than equal to here.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,470
Now what is Eagleman B?

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,960
Eight.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,040
So what is in this case, he was able to and B it is.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,010
But the it's again, we see that a common B is nothing but which are divisible by six.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,810
Eight, because those would be the breeding rate, because the one which are used by six are already

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,820
sold by two and three.

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,620
We have six and 12 here, but we have 10.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,930
Why?

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:30,280
Because two and five the humans and and four B and C, we have 15 those which are December 15.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,080
What about which are diesel by Altria area and C we have.

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,650
No, right, so this might be a common knowledge to all of us that how do we calculate this, how do

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,810
we calculate aiding in beating A.?

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,810
Very simple rate, which is we say OK, we include air include being Lootie.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,380
And we don't include Eagleman B in the S.C. and being D-S.C.

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,800
And then what we realize is that.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,980
There's a certain part which we have actually not included, which got included three times in ABC and

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,920
got subjected three times in a BBC, NBC at eight will include included again to understand this.

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,490
Let's keep on adding things here, right?

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,580
If I'm including air, that means I'm doing a +1.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,000
If.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,850
So that plus one means that we have included this, that's one plus one.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,850
So in all the parts of EA, in all, these are parts of AAA and these subsections, I just added +1

39
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,750
because they're included.

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,460
Now let's include B.

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,120
The to include B plus one plus one will be here also again and again, that means these are the parts

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
which will be included when include B.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,020
Now if I include C, so c included plus one here.

44
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,940
Plus one here and plus one here.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,360
Now what I what I was trying to do.

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,910
We are trying to remove a common B ito.

47
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,490
If this is a this is B and this is C, then e common because we all know what it is.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,330
Despite the audience, Bartlett.

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's subtract this part, so what where this subduction means, I'm doing a minus a day to do a minus

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,180
around is remove unpleasant, so minus one and minus one, that means this has been included.

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,390
So in the end, what we want to do is we want to include all of these.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,540
Exactly when they made.

53
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,240
So now what knowledge subject a common be?

54
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,420
A common wisdom knowledge object, a common see and then become A..

55
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,870
So a common see we have this part in Eagleman sees a let's remove vine from here and one from you.

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
Well, that means we have removed this.

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,400
Now let's subtract bekommen.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,700
See, one day right now you when you can easily see that you get this whole part is included.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,560
This hole is included.

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,490
This hole is included.

61
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,360
One, So that's good.

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,530
This part is included.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,990
This is also included, and this is also included, that is also good, but what about the middle part

64
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,560
here, right?

65
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,090
It was plus one three times and then minus one three times eight.

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,660
So we need the included separately.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,380
That's where we have less a common be common.

68
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,730
Right.

69
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,640
So let's move forward.

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,910
And I also, yeah, let's talk about Ford, OK, so we have seen how this something in three states

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,560
work before, Ford said.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,420
What we have is we have we are adding them individually, then we are subtracting them.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,300
When we are taking them in pairs, then we are adding them again in triplets and then we are again subjecting

74
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,660
them in.

75
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,190
All right.

76
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,930
That's the burden that you can observe read.

77
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,310
We add.

78
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,790
We subtract, we add, and then we subtract and so on.

79
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,450
Right?

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,010
So how does it become?

81
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,110
We add the odd elements.

82
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,980
What do I mean by broad benefit contains odd number of.

83
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,390
That's in them, right, so this is a state which is unique, which is the intersection of even number

84
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,810
of states.

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,170
This is a state which is intersection of our number of states.

86
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,860
Eight.

87
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,700
If it is all we are, including it, we're adding +1 date.

88
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,270
Otherwise, we are subtracting it so it becomes minus one.

89
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,420
It is to the public if NW is hard.

90
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,230
If any, even state, if any, is even then it becomes.

91
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,710
But action, if an is art, then it becomes outdated and need to begin.

92
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,200
I mean, you can easily derive this formula.

93
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,770
It doesn't interfere.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:37,960
No.

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,330
OK, so that was off for right when we have four sets, we add, subtract, add subject to how many

96
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,060
elements are there.

97
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,060
We choose one one one in them.

98
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,980
We have four one element.

99
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,630
We have four see two elements.

100
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,840
We have 43 elements and we have foresee what elements.

101
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,040
So similarly will happen in its 05.

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,350
I want you to write it, although there will be many sets here.

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,230
Because I will be including a weakened individual element and will be subjecting a B, e C and so on

104
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,820
and then will be including ABC.

105
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,080
And then we'll be subjecting a record above things.

106
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,680
And then we will be again adding ABC.

107
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,740
E!

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Well, so this is how it works, so how many are how many individual elements, five seven.

109
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,310
How many in fields five c two five six three five C for five C.

110
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,080
Right.

111
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,850
So how many total are there?

112
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,940
So if you take this sum, if you remember this, this is nothing to restore.

113
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,910
The power and brand is five in this case, minus one.

114
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,120
If you add all of them, it becomes two to power and minus one.

115
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,320
And also, if you take five six zero, then it is this really about eight eight.

116
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,880
This is how inclusion exclusion works.

117
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,140
Great.

118
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:02,610
So when we have our number of elements in our particular intersection, we added otherwise we subjected,

119
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,710
well, I'll be using this in the next.

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,000
A problem discussion and also in the cold video, right?

121
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,150
We'll see you there.

122
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,590
Thank you.
