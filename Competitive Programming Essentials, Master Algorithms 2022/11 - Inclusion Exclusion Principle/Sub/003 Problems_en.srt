1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,819
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,080
I have this first example that I want to present, which is a find eternal number of permutations of

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:17,300
zero two nine eight, so we have all single digits and the total number of permutations, which contains

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,680
one three.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,480
OK, so let's say which.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,560
Does not contain and will do otherwise, resulting in total populations of 0.9, which does not contain

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,920
13, 49, 34 or 23.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,650
OK, well, no problem.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,330
We can do the does not bite also, and we can do the other part too, right?

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,010
Let's do one part and then come to the other one.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,330
So how many permutations of 0.9 are possible?

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,980
We have 10 numbers here, so there are 10 factorial permutations which are possible today.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,340
So this is total number of permutations which are possible.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,030
So there are OK, how many permutations are there, which contains 13?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,880
So as we know that there can be many permutations which contain certain right, there can be many permutations

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,750
which contains 49, 34 and 23 eight.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,860
So how do we solve this?

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,450
And of course, there will be many permutations which will contain both 13 and 34 eight, like one,

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,560
three, four and something.

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,540
Let me give you some examples.

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:22,840
First.

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,000
So let's let's call up a mutation, which just contains one three eight.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
That means it should not contain other elements.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,140
So let's call it 13.

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,320
And let's straight forward here nine here so that it doesn't intersect and two here.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,190
Cool.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,620
And it's just fill it at seven.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,810
Five six.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,170
And zero eight.

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,860
So this is a population which just contains 13, and it does not contain 49.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,570
It does not contain 34 and it does not contain 23.

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,900
Similarly, you can make other permutations, which contains 49, 34 and 23.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,289
But let me give you an example of accommodation, which contains both 13 and 49.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,100
So what I can do is it's very easy to make it just bare them 13 and 49 and just fill the rest of the

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,880
digits.

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:27,370
It's a zero two three seven four five six seven eight and nine is already eight zip zero mutation,

37
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,330
which contains thirteen and forty nine point eight.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,150
So this does not contain 23, and this also does not contain 30 foot, as you can see.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,700
And similarly, you can make other examples, right?

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,280
There can be of a mutation which contains 13 and 34 like together, like I mean this way.

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:53,270
Ain't the how can I do this if I are going to find out whether a permutation contains 13 and 34, it

42
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,650
can contain it this way.

43
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,690
Right.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,100
That means it has 13, also 34.

45
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,960
There's a difference.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,980
Guys up there cannot be of a mutation, which contains 13 and 34 separately named because it can only

47
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,580
be used once in a mutation if it contains both.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,650
One three four it has to be together.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,640
Eight.

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,040
Yeah, two, one, three four.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,610
And similarly, fill the rest of the digits over here so that there are no other permutations watchable.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,860
So how will you solve this problem?

53
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,550
As we can see, there can be some combinations of these.

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,860
Numbers inside the permutations, right?

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,510
I will find out the total number of permutations which contains 13 and these these these.

56
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,410
So as I know, there are 10 factorial told by Malaysian trade.

57
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,270
So again, I will simply use inclusion exclusion over there, and it's not a very tough problem.

58
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:52,880
Eight.

59
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,550
And also this won't be required that this problem won't required much to could also aid.

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,240
But let's find out the total number of, let's call it b b.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,840
And if I did like 13, that means there are no permutations, which contains 13 13 means.

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,920
I mean only 13.

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,520
Nothing else.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,240
Eight.

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,940
And.

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,580
Then we can find out the total number of permutations, which contains 49 permutations, which contains

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,840
34 permutations, which contain 23 and so on.

68
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,040
So.

69
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,110
So how many more mutations are possible, which contains all these elements, we can see 13 plus 49

70
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,000
plus 34 plus 23, right?

71
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,870
That means.

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,130
All the permutations which have been included till now, which contains 13, but I'm not sure about

73
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,260
others and whether it may or may not contain 49, 34 and 23 in it.

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,800
If I include P. 49, that means it contains 49, but we are not sure about whether it contains 34 22

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,690
you in with it or not, and so date.

76
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,720
So this is the individual contributions of these elements.

77
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,450
Now let's subtract readable part of it.

78
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,140
That means.

79
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,450
Let's find out the permutations which contains.

80
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,010
Putting 49 in them, right?

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,120
Village break be 13 and 49 with this, let's celebrate B.

82
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,310
13 and 34 with this subject P. 13 and 23 with this subject B.

83
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,740
49 and 34 with this be 49, 23 and B 34, 23.

84
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,160
I hope you're getting the major point here.

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,730
And how will you figure out what is a certain number of elements here?

86
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,680
OK, we'll do that later.

87
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,910
Now, after this, what we'll do is we will need to add them individually.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:59,440
That means permutations which contain 13 as well as 49, as well as 34 plus permutations, which contains

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,220
13 as well as 49 as well, is 23 eight.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,870
And how will we find this out?

91
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,610
What are the total number of these permutations?

92
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,240
I'll tell you.

93
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,200
We'll figure that out.

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,950
And the second one can be 13.

95
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,200
34 and 23.

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,100
Right.

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,460
And the next one can be be 49, 34 and 23 will.

98
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,310
And the last one is simply subject, which contains all four of them, if possible.

99
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,900
Eight.

100
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,530
How do we do this?

101
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,780
How do we figure this out?

102
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,950
How can we calculate what their total number of elements?

103
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,090
It's very simple.

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,420
It's normal combinatorics, which is how many permutations are different.

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,910
The line which contains 13 in them.

106
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,970
So what you can do is speed up 13 together.

107
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,080
And what we have is we have either how many elements are left.

108
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,980
If I bring up other elements are left rate, which is zero point two.

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
OK, no one.

110
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,070
No one one two three four five six seven eight nine eight.

111
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,540
That means if I build this up, if I find out all the permutations of these numbers, that means, you

112
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,250
know, I live imitations of these numbers.

113
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,430
How many numbers are there now?

114
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,200
We have only nine am with eight because we have taken to them two numbers as one, because we are kind

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,900
of grouping them between all them relations.

116
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,040
One in three will be together.

117
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,920
The total nine factorial permutations are possible nine factorial possible, nine factorial possible,

118
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,380
nine factorial four days and nine Victorian for this.

119
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,320
Similarly, how many are there possible?

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,140
Four, 13 and 49 just.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,550
Entertain and 49 together, if you're betting and voting in together, we have the rest of the remaining

122
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,680
numbers, which are zero two five six seven eight.

123
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
How many total number area?

124
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,220
One two three four five six seven eight eight two.

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,470
I have to tell it elements in this.

126
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,500
And if I pursued these eight elements were delegates.

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,100
I'll get eight factorial permutations in all those infected by mutations, 13 will be together and 49

128
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,940
will be together.

129
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,290
That means I got all the populations of 18 49 that together.

130
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,900
Eight.

131
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,530
And similarly, we can find out for this.

132
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,950
This, this, this, this similarly for three, we can.

133
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,120
Pair them together, so so in this case, what we'll have is we'll have one.

134
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,610
Three.

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,970
Warren nine.

136
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,120
Together eight and then only responsible 13 with 34 with 49.

137
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,370
It's it will just bind them together like all the other numbers and which is zero to.

138
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,690
Five, six, seven, eight, eight two, how many are there now?

139
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,750
This will be counted as one two three four five six seven two seven factorial such permutations are

140
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,290
possible.

141
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,920
Well, Emily, you can find out for others and do it too late, so I hope you understand how inclusion

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,370
exclusion elders in solving these same problems.

143
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,670
You can take an example of three of them, four of them or five of them.

144
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,940
You already know how it works for any of them, right?

145
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,500
You can do is use a Brakebills Datablitz a break in force.

146
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,840
Add in five subject and six and so on, it will keep on going, Dylan.

147
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,230
Eight.

148
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:21,440
OK, now let's go on to another example, and this is the example, which we can, right, because right

149
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,870
now I'm taking very less numbers, which are 500 and just 48.

150
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,720
But when when will call will take very big constraint.

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,930
So those constant will not be so easy to be solved using.

152
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,950
And we will we will have to call them.

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,960
The next problem that I took is it's a very again famous problem, which is find a total look to total

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,830
numbers which are less than 500 and diesel by the first four prime numbers.

155
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,900
So I would just want to find out.

156
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,180
The total numbers, which are less than 500 and by differs for prime numbers are going to do this.

157
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,480
So what are the first four prime numbers, first of all?

158
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,000
Right, so let's call prime numbers as B and the first four numbers are two three five seven.

159
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
So how many?

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,030
Again, I'm taking an example of food, OK, let's let's burn it down to three or implicitly eight.

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,360
So total number of numbers, which are less than 500 individual by first three frames.

162
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,380
We can also do it for food.

163
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,070
It's very easy.

164
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,970
No look.

165
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,250
So what nobody will lose are divided into individual, said Aito said.

166
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,810
It contains or let's say.

167
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,930
And that means the most, which is about over less than 500, so how many of them are there?

168
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,370
Right now, I'm not including zero, OK, so let's call them natural numbers.

169
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,050
So how many are there?

170
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,010
Very simple.

171
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,990
It's 500 by two, the right 250 such numbers, or it is NY three.

172
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,940
That means 500 by three.

173
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,530
That means if I divide one by three, what what will I get?

174
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,950
I'll get one, six and six again.

175
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,160
Later, there are 160.

176
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,290
Fix them.

177
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,510
Yeah, 166 numbers which are divisible by three and less than 500.

178
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,320
Well, and and by five, it'll be 500 by.

179
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:17,770
Right.

180
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,600
And so here I have 100, 100 members out there, which are less than 500 and whose.

181
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,310
I hope this is very clear.

182
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,350
No, what is and two three here?

183
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,510
Now must be introduced by both three and five.

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,320
That means the numbers which are divisible by six.

185
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,460
Eight.

186
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,650
If if the numbers are disturbing to all three, although that means the numbers are usually by two three

187
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,100
six.

188
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,020
Right.

189
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,090
Because two and three does not have anything.

190
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,970
Means the cobra, I'm late, so if I wanted to find it Elysium the least common multiple of two three

191
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,290
and it will be six eight.

192
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,210
So how many numbers are diesel by?

193
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,110
It would reveal just six, which is it goes to and six, which is equal to 500 by six eight and this

194
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,590
will be.

195
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,510
OK.

196
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,970
Eight and 20 will give me three, eight, I think did three is correct.

197
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,660
What is +2 five?

198
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,080
It is nothing but and then eight, which is nothing but 500 by 10, which is 50.

199
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:33,610
And the final one is N3 five, which is N15, which is 500 by 15, which is three and three.

200
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,030
Well.

201
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,070
Now, finally, what we need is we need all which individual right to three and five.

202
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:48,300
So this is nothing but at a team of two, three and five, which is the three and five, which is 30.

203
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,580
Cool.

204
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,100
So how many of them are diesel by 30 and less than 500?

205
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,150
We have.

206
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,460
Fifty by three, and it gives me one in it.

207
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,630
Well, now we have all these numbers, eight, and I want to find out the total number of elements which

208
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,190
are less than 500 and usable by just first three planes, so I cannot add all I can take individually.

209
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,250
That means 250.

210
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,370
166 plus hundred.

211
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,080
Because they're individuals now subject 83.

212
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,180
Fifty three.

213
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,540
And then finally, add it in.

214
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:35,520
It this is nothing but inclusion, exclusion for picking individuals, a breaking event.

215
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,080
And then again, taking out.

216
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,570
All.

217
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,490
This was an example of three, right?

218
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,200
What if the constraints were, let's say, 10 to the power rating?

219
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,500
Instead of 500 and let's say, 10.

220
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:01,520
And there were 10, I mean, how many numbers are less than 10 to the power rating, which is divisible

221
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,680
by first and prime numbers.

222
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,880
How would you do that?

223
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,780
So that will become a very tricky for us to solve, right, because we have to make to do the power

224
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,000
10 different combinations.

225
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:23,780
As I already explained, rate individual prime numbers, then we'll take them twice and then we'll know

226
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,150
raising force and so on.

227
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,080
So this is not very feasible by doing it, doing it by hand.

228
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,030
So I just wanted to give you this example.

229
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,320
So then we can call this out.

230
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:42,200
And in the next tutorial, I'll just go this particular example, which is will take you into less than

231
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,840
this, which is of the first interregnum.

232
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,040
Well, oh, thank you, everyone.

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,790
And.

234
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,800
In the next part.
