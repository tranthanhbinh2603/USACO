1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:09,580
Always so welcome to the real four metrics explanation, the the explanation will come handy in various

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,460
dynamic programming problems and all those are all those problems in which you will be solving some

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,770
linear recurring solution.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:17,720
Eight.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,840
So for example, I'll give you the very basic example, and then we'll move on to various different

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,890
examples, of course.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,060
So.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,600
Right now, this small catfish here, and I'll help you prevent this cat face right away and will coordinate

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,540
things exponentially.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,020
I will.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,530
Not pass to the mattresses, but will work on during mattresses, in methods, in different methods.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,220
Eight or windows are a nuisance.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,770
They might be, but will avoid them.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,450
They will avoid nuisance.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,250
Now, let's understand how this matrix explanation work with an example.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,960
So let's take an example first.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,770
Let's say I want to find out.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,060
And it's Fibonacci number.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,640
And it's Fibonacci numbers, so it's a very famous series, guys, Fibonacci numbers cities because

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,760
it is being used in various places and there are some well-known facts about Fibonacci numbers, you

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,260
can easily search those facts.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,060
So if I want to find out the end, it's Fibonacci numbers.

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,060
So let me write first few terms of this series.

24
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,720
It is one one.

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,910
The first time is one.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,780
The second time is one.

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,630
Now, the third time is equal.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:33,130
The third term follows this pattern that f and is equal to f off and minus one plus and minus two.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:40,990
That means three will be equal to a fourth two three three minus one plus three minus two is f of one.

30
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,440
So the next term is equal to the sum of previous two terms.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,840
Eight.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,690
So it is two.

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,410
Two plus one is three five eight 13.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,660
Twenty one.

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,160
Party have a missed No.

36
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,540
13 percent to end its 34 and then 34 in next year's.

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,540
Thirty four in twenty one is five and five, fifty five and so on.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,070
So it's an infinite series.

39
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,380
It is never ending cities and after a certain time it goes like exponential rate.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,440
You can easily see this particular cities.

41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,250
So if I want to find out the end for when I can them, but and its end is less than equals to turn to

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,890
the power six, it becomes very easy for me.

43
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,720
I can directly use dynamic programming.

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,490
Dynamic programming.

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,740
Right, and a very simple cold case began easily undo this, not a big deal, if still you have a problem

46
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,260
using dynamic programming for finding just a Fibonacci number just to watch US action on dynamic programming.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,600
And in the first example will be of it when I give numbers in one day.

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,360
DP eight Not a big deal.

49
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,170
So running programming is not a big deal for African economics, but easy stuff.

50
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,620
What happens in the name of Ghadami is that you take an area of land, think about six eight, and what

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,590
you do is you calculate that are done by using the first two dams and you calculate the Fortnum by using

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,630
their second and third dome in you.

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,550
That means you take an area and you simply fill the first two times that d b minus one and b b who is

54
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,210
also one.

55
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,030
And then they re you add a loop from three to in and say the DPA is equal to that.

56
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,010
Maybe a is equal to DP I minus one plus API minus two.

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,240
So.

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,990
This is a normal loop from.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,900
You're doing great.

60
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,220
And after the loop ends, we have the end, no finish, so we have to be in after this end.

61
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,270
But guys, this is not the perfect solution that I want because it is for less than equal to 10 Dubai

62
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:02,210
with six and eight to four lots of my a of my friends got this problem is going to be a problem that

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,790
like a follow up problem they say now.

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,450
And this lesson in Gloucester turned the 18.

65
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,980
Now, how do you get to create this particular?

66
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:20,450
Even economically if and it's so huge, you cannot apply this law from three to 10 because again, we

67
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,590
cannot have attended the voting and it will take a huge time.

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:24,830
Eight.

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,150
How do you solve this, how do you figure this out?

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,020
What is the.

71
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,640
And also there is that number will be huge.

72
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,010
Of course, is this number will also be huge.

73
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,910
They're distributing queue of 10 to diversify.

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,850
It will also be huge.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,810
Generally, whenever you face this problem, they will say that they might just like big what is actually

76
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,470
a comp. It's actually a drawback of languages of the computer system we have now.

77
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,850
It may be not up to 100 or 200 years right now.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,560
This is a topic it's a bit more to.

79
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,040
They could it in in that limit.

80
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,670
You.

81
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,650
OK?

82
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,910
So how do you solve this problem in an instant, is it being so that's the main problem that we are

83
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,280
going to discuss in this election, right?

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,890
Here goes What I'll do is I'll take three.

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,540
Mattresses and just show you an example and everything will become all clear.

86
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,610
So let's take three mattresses.

87
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,140
The first mattress that I'm taking is a normal matrix, and let's call it.

88
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,270
Matrix F and kept live in this effort, Matrix is too gross value matrix, and in this I will be storing

89
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,200
Effen, which is the end for but and f of and minus one.

90
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,450
Well.

91
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,340
Now what happens is I have a Imitrex, let's call it biometrics, and I'll feel the value of it.

92
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,520
Oop, I want you to feel the values of the stigma have on you to find out the emergence of this dream

93
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,620
matrix, as if a multiplicity matrix to this effort matrix that is deep into effen this matrix give

94
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,700
me effen plus one.

95
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,930
It is this into this equals this f of endless fun to wherever, and I literally said, bend this one

96
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,460
and this one minus one is in.

97
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,950
What should be my be matrix of video games?

98
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,990
But easy that this f of endless one metrics is actually nothing but.

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,550
How is it ever and responded in it it is written as f and plus f minus one in the sum of previous two

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,520
terms in Fibonacci.

101
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,670
It is, and this is I if I dig two ones over here.

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,580
So this one multiplies with this happen and this one multiplies with this happen.

103
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,070
This rule multiplies with this column and gets me off of endless but eight.

104
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,500
Secondly, in the second, what we have to do is, guys, I won't happen to be here so I can take it

105
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,010
one zero.

106
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,760
If I multiply this rule with this column, it gives me a fine.

107
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,520
Well.

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,740
So Venezuela is not a big deal that if I multiplied the metrics with the F and it gives me, I think

109
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,810
this one eight now.

110
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,200
Now, let's see this if this if anything goes to evolve.

111
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,840
Rachel, let's get into it for you.

112
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
This will give me a of three similarly esteemed to of.

113
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,280
They will give me f off.

114
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,720
Similarly, they do it for food, will give me half of.

115
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,380
You and and so on.

116
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,180
It will go on forever.

117
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:47,400
So if I replace effort in this equation by the industry, then I can.

118
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,210
It is this way into being the F3.

119
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,260
Is Eagles do it four, five?

120
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,220
So let's say I'm just trying to find a fight.

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:05,450
So now let's replace FTD by using this equation here, where I get this thing to eat into e into a f

122
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,970
of a two is.

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,320
One more record is equal to three or four, five, eight.

124
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,820
So basically, guys, if I want to find out some f of RN and I know what it f of two, what do you have

125
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,100
to evolve to is nothing but of the F2 Dome and the F1 team, which is one one.

126
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,780
The base case is basically rate based cases.

127
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,289
So, yeah.

128
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,429
OK, so what happens is if I want to find out, be of end of this actually becomes the the power and

129
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,230
minus two yes or no.

130
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,430
Due to the power and minus two.

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,660
IndyRef2 is going to happen to win always, these all are mattresses which are being multiplied, multiply

132
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:02,550
follows that property, whatever it is associated or community in, which is to be in the sea, is equal

133
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,350
to A into B and C.

134
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,490
Hey, I'm just a blanket, probably over here, and simply I grouped all these, I'm just simply multiplying

135
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,790
all I'm just finding to the power in minus two.

136
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,050
What is do over here is the matrix.

137
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,190
One one one zero.

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,540
This is Matrix.

139
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,920
Hey, you know what?

140
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,680
What is the solution that I've come up to that if I want to find out if people, Nikki and I simply

141
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,490
have to find out the power in my next one multiplied by f of two that will give me effen, which is

142
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,030
even.

143
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:42,270
And if in minus one, and I'll just written the topmost value that will be called within the how do

144
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,480
I do this guy is how do I find due to the power and menace to?

145
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,570
Again, we can use binary exponentially here instead of multiplying to one by one here again directly.

146
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,320
Node by devouring minus two by using binary explanation because and minus two is an integer.

147
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,270
I can simply say by this time, empty of what what we'll do is we'll take a resultant.

148
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,390
Certain metrics that will be of one identity metric say other metrics will be 92 metrics and.

149
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,370
In each separate it needs to do is simple.

150
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,320
Just as binary exponentially, can we do that result in will be equal to resulting into if the last

151
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,250
British state and so on.

152
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,480
And so basically just consider it the city as another integer, right?

153
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,430
So we know as integers multiply, so so do matrix multiply.

154
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,850
As integers add up, so do mattresses add up.

155
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,480
Ed, I'm just.

156
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Instead of doing a by explanation of unity, then I'm doing in binary exponential matters.

157
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,210
It is called matrix exponential.

158
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,740
It's instead of in multiplications.

159
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,990
And in these editions, we'll be having methods between multiply mattresses and advocacy.

160
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:12,760
So those methods will not take 2D error as a as an argument because I'll be telling you a best way to

161
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,390
code this out and you won't be like having this face.

162
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,400
Whatever this.

163
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,860
It is eight.

164
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,940
I hope you I hope you got this that.

165
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:34,160
Instead of in business, we'll just use mattresses, multiply them, add them whatever we do, and simply.

166
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,930
Use it right.

167
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,810
So I think that's it.

168
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:47,210
And so, first of all, I want you to call it odious and like nightmare third-rate functions, if you

169
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,810
ever understood this part, just.

170
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,430
Do they do it yourself first and then move on to the next for you, during which I'll call it out there

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,530
are there are various examples.

172
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,740
Let me give you another example.

173
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,940
This was a very easy to kill installation and let me give you a tougher one.

174
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,550
If anything was to happen.

175
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,310
These are records of relation.

176
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,670
Any recurrence, so instead of getting left, let's have smaller.

177
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,630
F off and.

178
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:28,900
Is he close to Earth at 15 minus one plus B of f off and minus two plus c f off and minus three?

179
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,570
How do you all this?

180
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:41,090
So always, whenever you face, whenever you will just face a reconciliation, a regardless of religion

181
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,520
and you going to use medical expert intuition, my first advice for you will be to.

182
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,060
Make this.

183
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,970
Vector, I make this vector that is Effen and this vector, which is even less when you take Effen Vector,

184
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,580
like what?

185
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,180
What thinks I have to make the nest next, what word things and then make the de vector accordingly?

186
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,140
If I multiply to do this, I'll get this eight or.

187
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,840
So let's solve this just positively, if you don't want to solve this puzzle, we don't think about

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,950
it and then, uh, you dive into this hit ABC are some constraints right that are being given to us?

189
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,730
So as I said, first of all.

190
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,700
We will have this f matrix and we will take.

191
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,790
Many we keep on changing world, we need eight.

192
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,520
So here we have endless fun metrics.

193
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,350
Let's have fun here.

194
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,650
F1 minus one here, F1 minus two here.

195
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,010
And, yeah, reality, I have a friend one.

196
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,780
Offend.

197
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,860
I finally an F and minus one because I'm replacing and when and endless fun.

198
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,870
And it's I have the year eight or.

199
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,270
Instead of let's take one.

200
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,380
Welcome, come to know, why am I doing this?

201
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,200
So, yeah.

202
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:16,250
Now, let's make this symmetric case to make a friend +1, what I want is I want one find one that is

203
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,590
funny to have, but in not one.

204
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,810
I bet.

205
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,140
Not one I have.

206
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,900
I won't be into heaven.

207
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,920
Be into.

208
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,500
F minus one, the endorphin minus two, 20.

209
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,070
Which is equal to evolve and listen.

210
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey, not I want Evan in the second place.

211
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,350
So what is I in the second place?

212
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,420
It will be simple one zero zero zero.

213
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,680
It was Veneman replied the second row with this.

214
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:51,360
I will defend and it is zero one zero zero, then it is zero zero one zero eight.

215
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,050
So.

216
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,750
Yes, I did happen, I defend in my innocence, but here goes whatever it is, I don't want to be carried

217
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,260
forward.

218
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:06,060
I do not want a foreign minister to come at this location late, so the last straw needs to be changed.

219
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,910
What will I have in the classroom?

220
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,790
I want mind later it will be zero zero zero one.

221
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,660
So this is my teammate, this family played this dramatic stuff in Matrix 11 plus again and again and

222
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,590
multiplied by again again, f in my f in bliss two and then again and so on.

223
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,530
If I wanted to find out for friend is fine, go to the power end and simply multiplied by by if you

224
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,640
don't hate.

225
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,570
And you can easily solve this thing.

226
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,630
Well, guys, I hope you are able to.

227
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,450
Go back with this and in the next video, we will.

228
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,280
So this is another example of a bigger installation, you can have various examples.

229
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,120
Eight.

230
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,150
And now we will see an efficient way of cutting this in the next year.

231
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,770
Well, thank you, guys.
