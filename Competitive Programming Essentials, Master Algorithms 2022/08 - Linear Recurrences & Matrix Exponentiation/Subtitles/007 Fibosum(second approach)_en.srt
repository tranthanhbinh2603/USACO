1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,100
I will.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,880
So let's see this second approach.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,490
The other alternative approach of explanation only if you are not able to figure out the.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,050
This one, which is also a nice approach, it's just based on the property of people when I give numbers,

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,930
but just let it not be when I get on with some of this reading, we want to find some.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,030
So let's see an example of how to do it.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,910
Firstly, I always do.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,530
I always started by writing some aromatic notes Alexa didn't have read.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:38,690
Metric, and this is let's say it has some some deal and a.m. it has a Fibonacci number and because

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,280
some talent will look away from an IQ brain and it will also require if you're going to crewneck in

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,650
numbers and minus eight now.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,490
What is the next metric that we can have if I multiply it by a metric into this metric, I should get

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,020
an F. And plus one metric.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
So this replacing and by and plus one or more, should I get a cent plus one plus one?

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,710
F.n minus.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,370
Right, right.

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,290
So this was.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,900
But yeah, this should be if.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,590
And not defend my innocent.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm replacing and by and press one right now again, Israel really major Demetri, which is very easy.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,290
No, because after use these three things to make sense one what it is in Brisbane and it is as an plus

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,830
and +1 something and +1 200, which is Santaland to +7 +1.

23
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,800
So how will this will be?

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,350
It is very easy in Brisbane as it goes through F and +7 minus one.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,730
So basically the sum of all three, right and the next I.M.F. and +1 247 +1.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:57,060
It is f.n plus and minus 1.8, which is nothing but some of both the lower terms and the last one is

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,670
Effen.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,040
I want to just find out if and which is does this cross diagonal?

29
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,810
So this is the thematics that's prepared for me for this particular f matrix.

30
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,210
And this is F and +1 metric in case.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,050
So.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,550
Let me just quickly share an example that it will work.

33
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,780
So the metrics in one one one zero one one zero one zero eight.

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,720
Let's see.

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,280
This metric is the basic let's make a base case we have and minus one here, right?

36
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,600
Let's make the best guess.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,700
Let's replace and buy one.

38
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:40,320
Well, so this becomes F1, which is still one quantum is one, because if is one and if and minus one

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,710
is zero.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Well, guess what will be the multiplication of these two mattresses sort of be one plus one two.

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,020
And the next will be one here only, and the last one will be zero.

42
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,120
I hope, OK, the lawsuit will not be zero, it will be this one into this one.

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,900
It will be one eight.

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,430
This is the.

45
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,770
And plus one, which is after metrics and this content is to come to terms of it being accurate, which

46
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,720
is free when I get zero blasphemy in a given blasphemy anarchy to which is the OnePlus One.

47
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,720
It is true.

48
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
I hope you got this.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,070
And again, if you multiply the time matrix with F.

50
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,210
Let's see if I multiply to Matrix with F2 or delete Alhadeff.

51
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,500
Three.

52
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,740
You can try this.

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,410
Well, let's call it out quickly.

54
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,700
And yeah, so this is just some previous code.

55
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,430
And let me just remove this.

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,050
I wouldn't change anything over here in the matrix structure.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,060
And I just, yeah.

58
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,150
So this is the function for some will pass into it, and it will give me the sum of some of the anthem.

59
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,550
Always.

60
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,460
So, yeah.

61
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,880
Let me.

62
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,730
Hmm.

63
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:55,650
Yeah.

64
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:06,750
So let's see out ribosome, and we want to find out some detail and dump minus ribosome tail and minus

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,710
one dumb eight.

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,500
So here we can see that an is and can also be zero.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,540
That means and minus one can also be negative, which is minus one.

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,090
Took.

69
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,149
Let's write some basic ISS, which is very simple if N is minus 100 and zero.

70
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,540
Right.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,980
If and in zero.

72
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,050
What is the sub Murphy when I get the results of zero and if any is.

73
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,530
One.

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,030
And let's return one.

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,980
Well, it's written these three values now we know that.

76
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,930
Is greater than equal to age, so here, let me try that end is greater than equal to eight.

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,550
Now we have a resultant metric that we used to have.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,930
This is the time metric that I have to make.

79
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,310
So the two metrics is one one one in the first two.

80
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,310
But do you not?

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,670
Zero zero is equal to do, you thought zero one is it goes to Detroit.

82
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,730
Zero two is it goes to one.

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,830
So fill the first room with one.

84
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,770
And also you can see that the size is three now.

85
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,980
That means all the mattresses here will be off regrows.

86
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,030
Three eight.

87
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,250
I hope.

88
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,970
Don't get confused, Rachel.

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,490
You're going to increase or decrease the sizes you want to.

90
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:28,740
And second row is zeroes on the second part, so let me quickly remove this 30 01 and 02 is one.

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,160
And the third one, we have it in just the middle part.

92
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,970
Let me remove this and let me also remove.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Right.

94
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,160
So as you can see, we have this zero zero advise, everyone will be.

95
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,550
We have these ones and everything else will be zero.

96
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,890
Now this is obaseki's eight.

97
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,800
So in the best case, I can.

98
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,700
Yeah.

99
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,230
So any greater than he going to do now?

100
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,870
Basically, if I let's see if I pass and go straight to here, what will happen?

101
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,190
It won't go here all.

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,830
This will fuel knowledge and is he going to do so, this value will go to so will it, meaning it will

103
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,290
try to find quiet of it?

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,470
Basically, it will find b squared.

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,040
Into whatever devices I'm multiplying rates, the base case here is nothing but this, which is one

106
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,400
one zero, which is F1 eight.

107
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,750
So I'm trying to multiply when would be square, but that should not happen because he's going into

108
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,490
everyone will give me f 2D and will not give f too late.

109
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,170
So if I'm passing and as to here, let me subtract and buy one and minus equals to win it.

110
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Why am I subtracting and revenue?

111
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,660
Because if an is being possessed, I just want to find out the rest of it and minus four and not be

112
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,000
destroyed.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,780
The power in those areas to the power and minus one into the base case is giving F2 and not F1.

114
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,310
I hope you got this.

115
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:10,340
Well, this is we are just subtracting one, because because let me also quickly write this because

116
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,230
it's quite urban history.

117
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,730
But F3 the which will give some till date similarly to you.

118
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,400
F1 is f word, right?

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,680
Basically, if necessary, then we are getting forward on.

120
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,450
So but we want parents, Rachel, I'm just subtracting and buy one so that we can get the third answer.

121
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,920
I hope that's fine.

122
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,010
Now, after this, we have found out that there is.

123
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,270
This matrix is.

124
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,330
We have hired the Treasury Department and minus one.

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,380
And after I found out the details of the boat and minus one, what I can do is.

126
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:52,170
I just have to multiply the first rule with the first column of the year because I just want S&M right

127
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,040
here.

128
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,810
I just want be as intimate.

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,830
I just multiply, defy stroke with the with this column, which is one one zero.

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,630
But indirectly, what will happen?

131
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,250
This will get multiplied by this.

132
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:12,220
This will get multiplied by this rate, and this will get multiplied by this to basically f and minus

133
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,080
one is zero because of the base case.

134
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,250
OK, let me let me read to you.

135
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,830
Basically, this deal is to the Bible, something let's let me call it get into the base case.

136
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,510
What was the base case one one zero?

137
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,050
We know the first rule will get multiplied by the system, so let me write first rule SABC eight.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,990
So it will be in the OnePlus being the one OnePlus seen to zero.

139
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,750
We are not considering see what we'll do is we'll say in India and has been doing it, which is nothing

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,299
but result in dam zero zero e and is rendered M01, which is B.

141
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,030
I'm not taking the 3rd value because if I take this R value, I say this let's say zero one two, I

142
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,880
have to multiply it by zero rate a base in the base case.

143
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,330
We we saw that it's zero the f in metric.

144
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,700
We will not multiply this.

145
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,510
And finally, we'll take Maude and Randy values.

146
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,080
I hope this works.

147
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,550
Let me bill this quickly.

148
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,130
OK, it's who.

149
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,270
Zero zero rate.

150
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,460
So let me quickly go over this again, I don't think so, there should be an error.

151
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,950
This is the diametric the Dimitrescu's zero one one zero one two and.

152
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,450
And one or Kilkeel, guess what?

153
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,570
This is the first rate in the first rate should be one one.

154
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,300
And in the second, Richard, be two one.

155
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,030
My word?

156
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,350
Right now, we are seeing good numbers.

157
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,670
My word, sorry, guys.

158
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,380
Because in the first story, it should be one day I just copy paste it.

159
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,820
It always happens with me whenever I copy paste things.

160
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,760
So here what we have, we have 14 and yeah, so it will still not work away because I'm subjecting rate,

161
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,590
let's say the numbers are huge.

162
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,760
If I subtract them, they will not give me the right number because of the model's properties and reduce.

163
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,670
I'll add more.

164
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,610
And then I'll again ignored.

165
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,420
And then this should give me the overdoses as these movies.

166
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,640
Also, it was giving me the right answer, but I just remember this is the smallest puppy.

167
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,210
Don't ever forget this if you subtract.

168
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,490
So there was a time when I was giving some long talent and it took me two days to realize this because

169
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,860
at the time I was going to do programming, no one was going to tell the eldest part to me.

170
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,340
And it took two days to figure out that it might just be smart.

171
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,520
It might not be if I want to do more.

172

To the.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,180
Yeah, let me submit it also.

177
00:10:53,410 --> 00:11:02,340
Also, I would strongly suggest that you all try it once before and then somebody will do.

178
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,190
Thank you, everyone.

179
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,940
In the next part.
