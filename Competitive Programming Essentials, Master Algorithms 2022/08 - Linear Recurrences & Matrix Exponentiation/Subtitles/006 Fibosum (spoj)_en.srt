00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,300
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,980
Let's solve this problem.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,720
You blossom from spot.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,500
So it's very easy in the problem statement.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:15,340
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation f zero 07 their values and finishes, f

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,080
and management both have in mind Do we all know this?

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,820
So your task is very simple given to non negative integers and in them you have to calculate the sum

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,050
f.n plus f and +1 belief.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,880
And basically, you have to find out the sum of these series of Fibonacci animals from f.n to F.M. made.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,090
And, of course, Marty, that we know about Madrid.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,410
So this is the input Elaine's, and after all this, Elaine will have zero three, three five and all

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,870
these things.

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,660
So how do you approach this problem?

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,930
We've already seen how to find out from an economist using matrix experimentation.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,870
Well, there are two approaches for this problem.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,940
The first one actually, both use this dramatic explanation.

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,190
There are two different ways of using it.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,660
The first one is to.

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,860
We got all Peregrine's solution laid off the summer as we saw.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,840
We were making the Imitrex when it emerged we had many things.

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,580
Similarly, we can take some, like some of some isn't.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,740
Let me name their term.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,570
It's called Essen.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,740
It's called Essen or Desisyon.

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,820
Essen is.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,620
Some and entry, we're not going to be secluded zero, 0.7.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:44,980
Let's f to l f and wait, and then some will be a similar thing in f m and if we subtract s m minus.

28
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,300
And.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,270
Or instead, let's minus as a minus one, then we can simply get what we want, which is.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,430
Some from Dylan, eight days, I hope we all know this because it's perfect, some trait of some some

31
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,080
foreign aid is although some minus the previous, some remove it and we'll get this.

32
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,240
I hope this is very clear.

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:17,000
But then how do of you know this and you can make it to America in which you can Edison and then see

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,910
how does that you can make an effort matrix in which you can Anderson.

35
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,780
Right?

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,260
We can have a third very well.

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,590
That is.

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,510
And finally, you going to have a.

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,150
Safety metrics accordingly.

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,700
That's one of the approval discussed there as well.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,300
But before moving to that approach, I want to discuss a very nice approach.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,150
It's based on the property of Women Act numbers and will derive that property rate.

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,200
So A.

44
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,960
We say that Effen is equal to.

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,840
If.

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,790
And minus one plus F. and minus two.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,320
So let's see what f and minus two here is.

48
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,740
They'd have been minus two is equal to in.

49
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,500
Minus f in minus one.

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,970
I hope you agree on this point.

51
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,360
Right.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,690
So, well, the what will we have in minus three here?

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,810
It will be nothing but f and minus one minus f minus.

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,080
Know, I hope we are on the same page over here.

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,580
And so until.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,940
Let's zero what did have zero?

57
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,100
OK, let me read one more and then we'll do so until it's zero.

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,440
It is a in minus 40.

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,030
It goes to a friend minus.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,920
I've been minus three, minus F and minus.

61
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,360
To date, and in many ways, I am assuming the most three and minus.

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,150
Two, am I doing something wrong here?

63
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,510
And I've been minus two is offend minors, I've been minus one.

64
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,390
OK, so f and ministries f in minus one minus f in minus two.

65
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,900
Eight, 11 minus four is equals to.

66
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,060
F in minus C.

67
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,570
Okay, so I think this two and three should be replaced.

68
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,630
And so until eight zero zero zero is nothing but a fourth.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,530
Let's put zero in this, and let's put any goes to do here, right?

70
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,620
It will give me half of zero and this will be f of two minus f off one.

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:36,430
I hope this is right now is whatever ad the allergies and the additives it, let's add these values.

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:45,450
This values this is nothing but as zero plus f one plus so until f and minus two.

73
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,080
Eight a.m. What is on the allergies on the on the orange is the right hand side?

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,690
I can easily see that this cancels out this.

75
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:00,380
Similarly, this cancels out this late because minus plus minus plus they all really can sit on each

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,650
other.

77
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,150
And in the end, F2 will also get cancelled out because of some values over here.

78
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,220
I what we'll get will get is he goes to f in minus f one.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:11,920
Right.

80
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,990
What what I can see here is that they're still in, but still and minus two aid because they're just

81
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,340
starting from zero and going till and minus two is equal to 11.

82
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,770
Minus one, everyone is one night when I can find.

83
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:38,050
So if I want, let's replace and ban and let's replace an endless loop or delegate Elliot Essen, is

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,260
it going to evolve?

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,450
And plus two minus one.

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,490
A very symbolic resolution.

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,660
So if I if I if I want to find out.

88
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,000
S m minus Essen, which is equal to thirty.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,020
Yeah, I want to find out the some from I'm doing day to f am doing.

90
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,960
This is what S.M minus.

91
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,700
Let me not add the brackets minus as in minus one, which will be what is S.M according to this equation,

92
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,890
it is f off and plus two minus one minus what?

93
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,170
What will be S.N. minus one?

94
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:25,090
According to this relation, it will be f off and plus one minus Rite Aid because here I am and minus

95
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,040
one here I and burned minus one.

96
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,900
So this investor will become an plus one.

97
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,760
Well, let's break this, this cancels out this.

98
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,080
What I have got four plus two minus F and plus one.

99
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,330
Right, so this is the final answer, and we all know how to find out if we win a case and was right,

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,690
we can easily find out FMI plus two.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,740
We can easily find out if and plus one will can subtract them and more ignored because that model of

102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,680
Robert is important.

103
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:04,240
Don't forget them aid because in sports, the answer is required after taking not, subtract them,

104
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,190
add more and then take more.

105
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,930
I hope this is very fine aid so you can easily go to now because there's nothing left.

106
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,370
And we have already coded how to find out if we were taking no.

107
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,530
Well.

108
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,840
Well, thank you, everyone.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,350
Let's see you in the next part in which we will be using Matic's explanation to figure out this.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Coalition will.
