1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,120
And everyone, welcome back to this Victoria Informatics six foot incision coding part in the last rural,

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,550
we went through matrixes Financiacion and now we want to code it out.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,590
It's so basically we just have to.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,360
The mean part of it is to have it devouring it and.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,210
Yes.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,680
So before that, let me tell you some good problems.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,140
I think so it is CQ.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,780
This is a problem called on board.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,120
You can try this problem after this particular tutorial and there's another SBP.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:42,770
You can also go to one spot to solve these two problems after this and get your hands on metrics exponentially.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:43,820
Cool.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,780
So firstly, yeah, so here we are.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,690
Normal code, I've just taken it as wrong because we'll be using more again and again because guys,

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,310
very easy thing, you'll notice that if I want to find out Fibonacci number of that, bigger heights

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,900
of that, some effort about it rate, so its value will be huge.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,380
I can't even imagine that huge.

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,830
What I'll do is I'll just take some more there.

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's take a 07:29 pool and let's find out the Fibonacci numbers.

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:20,780
So.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,360
Of art in the Indomie, let's say I have RN and let's call it in Italy, right?

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,890
It's I want to find out why.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,860
What is the fifth Fibonacci number plate?

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:38,430
So I'll just be out and highlight a function or method which will give me the energy when I get eight

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,440
going, babe.

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,630
And and will come away and then through an economic hole.

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,400
So how do I quote this?

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,450
How do I make a matrix?

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,270
So as I said, guys, I'll be using a very special method, which is a structure in structures we don't

29
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,600
have to.

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,300
We won't be worried about passing on.

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,320
Different the eddies and other stuff you hate, what I do is.

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,530
A very simple.

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:15,530
Firstly, I just dig a matrix instead of all, let's take em and let's give it, let's give it a Constance's

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,600
rule.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,090
So constant size is two initially incinerate because four, according this, but that is.

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,320
When I give our trade, we we need to cross remittances, and this is to cross-pollinate metrics.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,650
Here you will realize one thing that we don't need even metrics.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,690
We don't need f and plus one metrics.

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,100
We just need to use metrics and we'll find do the power and minus two.

40
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,860
And when I have to do the power and minus two after this, I just need to multiply that by one one.

41
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,760
What does this mean that if I take just first two terms and add them of thee, that will be equal to

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,290
if I multiplied the first two with one one and get F and some eight?

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm not like going f in metrics and f and both metric because we don't need it.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,150
We just want the metrics and it's about eight.

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,130
So here I just take a structure.

46
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,500
Metrics so lazy will easily see that.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,920
Why is it being so useful to us by taking this?

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,350
That is being very useful to us right after this.

49
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,770
Alex Rider constructed metrics, and what it will do is it will just simply said this to zero.

50
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,500
It will set all the terms to zero.

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,290
Well, after this let's item method, which will return, which will convert the matrix to an identity

52
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,600
form, what is an identity matrix?

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,000
It is one one one under-diagnosed or let's write a function called identity.

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,390
We need this identity.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,880
I've already explained this to you.

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,320
Why do we need identity?

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Because instead of resultant resulting in multiplication was born in in addition to zero, it is an

58
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,900
identity element in metrics.

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,340
It should be noted in duty metrics.

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,920
So from I will go from zero to size and what I do it is I'm off base.

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,070
Race is equal to one.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,220
I just in the diagonally, I will put all.

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,800
This is an identity matrix.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,100
Eight.

65
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:21,230
And now let's go to the last word of this structure metrics and the most important part that is I want

66
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,760
to multiply two matrices.

67
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,410
Eight.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,660
So how do I multiply two matrices if?

69
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,230
If you if not, if you have not heard about what are we going to do?

70
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,000
Operator overloading, just go and check it out.

71
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:45,260
It's a it's a very, very nice tone like out of OPA Overlord and operator eight I defining this that

72
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,470
if I use a multiplication anywhere, then this particular function will be called.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,080
This is called an operator, overloading late.

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
I simply pass a matrix to it.

75
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,420
And what I do is I simply now nothing if I see Matrix.

76
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,280
OK, let me give you an example.

77
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,740
If I say metrics, are I just going to?

78
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,340
Metrics are and I see if is he to OD into, let's say, another matrix Q I didn't do Q.

79
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,390
That means all these metrics are this operator is defined.

80
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,650
There is a multiplication operator.

81
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,660
After this, this Q matrix will be parsed as an argument to the function of.

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,720
That means art method will be called where it will be, Bosasa metrics are different metrics as an argument.

83
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,620
Now what I need to do is I need to multiply.

84
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,570
These were these four mattresses.

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,150
That means it has been passed to the.

86
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,260
Argument to the method is an argument, and I have to just multiply them.

87
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,170
I don't have to do much part here now.

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
What I simply say, I just take a matrix.

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,190
Let's call it resilient.

90
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,830
So, guys, how do I multiply two mattresses into a third mattress?

91
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:07,100
If this is a matrix, a this is a matrix, be eager to see Matrix because both these metrics are off

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,910
to to who goes to do grows too will give me two grows to eight.

93
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
If I received the E!

94
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,990
F e.

95
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,980
What is this storm?

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,770
It is, he goes to the first row, multiplied by bicycle eight.

97
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,190
So matrix multiplication is actually and this will be actually size cube algorithm, right?

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,460
Because we'll be using triple for loops here by triple values, because you fill one location of this

99
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,940
matrix, you fill one location of this matrix.

100
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,430
I need to go for the rows and for all the columns of both The Matrix, it's into three eight.

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,780
So let's do this then.

102
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,800
So let's go from I0 to.

103
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,460
Size and then let's go from day zero to buddy.

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,490
So I'm not I'm just not doing anything here.

105
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Not not a big deal.

106
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,400
No, I'm not doing a big deal of it at eight.

107
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,490
It's a very simple --, just multiplying two mattresses.

108
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:15,300
The first mattress is this that is my all metrics that this I've already been taking matrix of it and

109
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,250
passing to it as an argument.

110
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,040
And the third mattresses resulted in which I'm storing.

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,220
So this is a metric that I will return.

112
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,370
Before all these locations of IED, that means for all these resultant IED, what I need to do is I

113
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,150
need to simply.

114
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,510
Have one more variable called.

115
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,460
Right.

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,140
And what will Discovery will do in?

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,140
For 30 days, it will be blessed with two.

118
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,830
M.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,460
I e that means chaos going on.

120
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,110
That means it's constant.

121
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,710
While the first matrix for this matrix are is constant and gays going one by one, I had for all the

122
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,490
columns and for the second matrix, what I do is simple it will be equal to a dot and that means is

123
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,510
matrix eight.

124
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,340
A., M. e.g..

125
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,100
Hey, on second Matrix column is constant and we are simply moving down the slope.

126
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,200
It's just a normal multiplication and addition.

127
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,650
And after this word, what we need to do is in this alternate using.

128
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,390
We'll just ignore it and do it by name just seven so that the value doesn't exceed that limit.

129
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,260
And finally, this certain metrics, which will be stored in a well.

130
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,789
This is a normal matrix multiplication gates, normal medical operations.

131
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,720
You can easily see it has become so easy right now if you would be writing different methods and providing

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,230
to the.

133
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Arguments, Stuart, it in won't take those arguments because they cannot be passed.

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,710
So, Ernest, also a very easy matter.

135
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,090
Now you will easily see the similarity between the by an exponential and meticulous one ingestion rate.

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,900
Now you will see it.

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,840
So initially what I'll do is I'll just take the resultant.

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Metrics and what should be resurgent metrics be, it should be.

139
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,480
Identity matrix case is written should be identity because I have to multiply the image to destroy it.

140
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,910
Now, guys, let's take the matrix goatee that we have defined over here.

141
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:24,880
Eight.

142
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,900
Where is Steve Maddox?

143
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:33,270
Yeah, I just have to in Italy, all all zeros or t dot m zero zero.

144
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,320
I have one e dot m at zero.

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,150
One.

146
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,190
I have one and dot em one zero.

147
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,090
I have one aid to add these three locations, I have one in this matrix who can easily see, well,

148
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,240
I just feel that the Matrix and now what is the need?

149
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,660
The need is very simple and.

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,230
If I want to find an interview when I can and what I have to find nobody to the and minus to it, we

151
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,520
have already discussed this part by in minister is needed because I have to multiply it by two.

152
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,380
Let's find out due to the power and minus eight.

153
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,890
So it's a breakdown.

154
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,670
And.

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,180
So before these guys, let's make a case, if an is less than equal to do, then what we do is we'll

156
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,590
simply run one pool and the way will simply subtract then by two and do the normal exponential you hate

157
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,720
by violin, if anyone.

158
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,340
It means it's an odd number is written as equals two, resulting in two.

159
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:42,180
Eighty eight and easy goes to be in duty there just to square the normal thing that we did.

160
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,740
And instead, she goes, You to look, you can easily see it has become so easy.

161
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,040
If I use the normal operator overloading, if I define a structure matrix is indeed very easy, guys.

162
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,900
If you have coded this out, if you're trying to score Gordon, just this.

163
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,010
Compare your code with Michael Wright and you will realize the differences.

164
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,330
After performing this value, what I'll have is I'll have a property that that I want.

165
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,210
I'll get to do the power and minus two in resultant.

166
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,950
Where in this progress to rate?

167
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,570
So I just have to add the first two terms in them to what else in Britain, resulting dot m zero zero

168
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,360
plus is rendered m zero one.

169
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,160
And also I have ignored you guys.

170
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,340
Never forget mod.

171
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,210
Oh, yeah.

172
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,900
OK.

173
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,040
But you not I it will be, I know, chases.

174
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,750
Yeah, just just let me check for some.

175
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,880
It is not the rate is returning, but M, my bet is it is a structured and integrated.

176
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,570
They took no idea, so what is he when I give five, it is five as in the output sick.

177
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,070
Yeah, the fifth time is fine.

178
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,750
So let's check for the system.

179
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,480
We will discuss the complexity it great, Bentham.

180
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,670
One two three four five six seven eight nineteen fifty five.

181
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,560
It's working perfectly.

182
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, this is the normal explanation, but we have discussed.

183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,780
This is a matrix.

184
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,280
Right.

185
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,480
And.

186
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,520
Yeah.

187
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,800
So now it's their time to discuss the complexities.

188
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,110
So what is the complexity of this law?

189
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,020
It is not often and this is.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,180
Log off and of log often, and in this world is happening, data matrix multiplication functions being

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,790
called place.

192
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,430
What is the time that the Matrix is taking to be multiplied?

193
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,950
It is size into size into that.

194
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,190
Is there this ice cube or do you say there two nature?

195
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,290
It is basically Tokyo, which is eight in do log off and eight so.

196
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,220
Isn't it so?

197
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,350
Any rate so that it is regulated at a size cube into or off lock and.

198
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,250
Hey, if any relating to the poverty, Dean, it becomes 64 in two it.

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,570
It's not a complex, it nothing, not even in 3-D, it's.

200
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,150
It so, yeah, so it's not even in four digits, it's just less than a thousand.

201
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,720
So that's the beauty of expert gates.

202
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,480
Well.

203
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,600
They've given you various examples of excellent intuition and by any explanation how they can be done,

204
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
how they can be coded out.

205
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,800
So this is a complexity here.

206
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,600
We cannot ignore says, because for this example, Earth values for so it will be for cube into law

207
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:50,930
of an.

208
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,950
It was at this size cannot be ignored and of course, goes after it, I just want this Borduin to go

209
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,020
to these problems as USP.

210
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,640
And there's another problem said it's called SB two because SB records the sequence something.

211
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,280
And then there's another thing it is people some unspoilt.

212
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,620
Try that, too, if you wish to.

213
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,900
Well, I hope this school is very clear to you guys, and the complexity of it is also very clear to

214
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,350
you guys.

215
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,770
So that's it.

216
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,290
In the next part, thank you.
