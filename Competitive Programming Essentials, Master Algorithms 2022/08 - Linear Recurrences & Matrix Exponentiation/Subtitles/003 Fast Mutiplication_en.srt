1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back, guys.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,740
So forever, very cool problem for you, and first of all, I want you to go through this.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,270
And there are.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,650
And types of people in the world, those who understand binary and those who don't.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,010
So is this 10 or.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,730
You can convert this to binary rate.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,070
Well.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,270
Now, let's move on to the.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,360
Problem, so the problem is very nice, and it will give you a deeper dive into what is actually.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,500
Binary explanation, it's a divide and conquer approach.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,900
Right, but we are actually using manipulation to code.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,350
Despite eight to.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,640
The problem is very simple, you are going this in C++, I do not think of any other language because

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,530
it will become very easy, so.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,590
What do you have is you have been given tremendous.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,239
Eben, see, the fun fact is that all these three are less than equals referring to the power 15.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,170
Eight.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,910
And what do you want to do is you want to find out.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,830
E into B.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,440
My seat.

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,710
So you want to find out this interview, Marty, how do you do it?

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,230
So just imagine yourself sitting in an interview and solving this problem just because the video.

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,550
And try to do this, though, of course, guys, brute force won't work, so you can't just see out

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,070
into b more to see.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,100
Vote by.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,750
By brute force won't work.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,350
Because.

28
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,870
Place, because is often the 15 inch wheels of train to the bar, 15 range.

29
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,480
If you multiply them even like even in like inside or if you're just multiplying them.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,810
This this is actually exceeding my long, long into range.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,660
Even Unsane long, long interchanges also being exceeded.

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,560
If you multiply these two values because the range of the new number will go around 10 to devour poverty

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,420
rate, which cannot be stored in any format, it can be stored in string eight.

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,340
But that will become again a heavier task recorded in it as strings.

35
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,130
And you have to do that pen and paper job again.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,730
So I'm not asking for a string solution, but a good one.

37
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,830
So how do you do it, guys?

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,180
But this won't work.

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,240
We are very clear with this because this is going above the limit of my long longing and it will give

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,230
me a garbage value for garbage value.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,000
Marty will be another garbage that you will.

42
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,480
So this is not working.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,270
The second is some of you might be thinking the second approach and that is e might see.

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:03,560
Into we might see Nazi hate, so that's how we distribute my inside when we are trying to find is again,

45
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,060
there is the same reason.

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,780
So let's see.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,830
Let's see.

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,950
That is equal to be is equal to 10 to 12 15 and see is equal to 10 to 12 15 minus one.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,230
It is nine 14 times at eight.

50
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,730
Whatever.

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,930
So if you take a Motsi.

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,680
OK, so I think I have just reversed the situation.

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,610
So let's say, as he was too busy with strapped into the power.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,720
15 minus one.

55
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,800
Right and seized and about 15, if you take MRC, then it will be only because C is greater than the

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,650
similarly guys B Morsi will be.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,990
B only because it is greater than.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,340
Because she's going to then be an Rachel, what does this problem statement conversion do, what does

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
it actually become?

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,660
Becomes a normal statement.

61
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,880
It is going to be Marty.

62
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,930
Well, NBA legend and inches awkward isn't going to work.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,520
What I mean to say is this more is unnecessary in this case.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,320
Again, more than we are offering 15 and above 15, all of them out of this range.

65
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,260
They can't, cannot be multiplied by brute force.

66
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,110
I just want you to.

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,930
If you're not like if you want.

68
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:30,080
And so this is normal unit that you are watching this video on the topic of binary multiplication,

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,420
so instead of exponential be a multiplication.

70
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
This is nothing different.

71
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:35,960
So.

72
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,480
It like it's a golf utility, but it's like relatable from this to this, you can easily relate.

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,540
It is in binary explanation what happens?

74
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,880
Let's read a binary multiplication.

75
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:06,520
Binary explanation, what does it do, is it calculate it to be and this will get great aim to be more

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
than will be taken later, do not worry about that March eight.

77
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,350
The counting is in by next one injection.

78
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,690
It is actually a multiplied buildings.

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,440
Your name's brought in by animal application, it is a plus a plus e plus a few times in both.

80
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,340
What we'll do is we'll simply divide.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,300
Or break?

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,380
Being too binary.

83
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,340
Eight and.

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,400
The rest of the part will remain same late.

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:44,420
So here in like minded expert intuition, I was actually multiplying anyway, resulting in binding multiplication.

86
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,860
I will simply add it to the resulting theorem.

87
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,480
So you saying, is it going to be a square part in finding multiplication tables is equal to twenty

88
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,440
eight?

89
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,550
What does I mean that if I want to find out in two?

90
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,970
That is let's take an example to Windows 10.

91
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,230
So how can this better than this can in this window for?

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,620
But if doing to eight plus blustering to do.

93
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:16,580
And because they were divided and into Bindi's, not a big deal, guys divided the next term into binary.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,470
And finally, do they do these multiplications and continuously take note eight who are very easy are

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,550
very easy to disguise.

96
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,740
So let's call it out.

97
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,940
I don't think much explanation is needed here.

98
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,060
A.

99
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,910
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,020
If I want to yeah, this is let me say how I saved it.

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,920
Yeah, I've saved it.

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,500
So let's multiply.

103
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,390
My deep lie.

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,680
Let's multiply it into B.

105
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,710
With some with some sort of sea instead of this smart and.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,210
At stake, this is retained as he goes to one guy, it's not a big deal.

107
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,680
So again, until I have B, then what I need to do is simple.

108
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,420
If.

109
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,540
I don't I don't know why today it is it.

110
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,990
If B and one, then resulting in close to deserted place.

111
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,150
Not my reply this time is it goes to India.

112
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,360
We.

113
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:26,440
Or instead, we can record everything is a political story, and we let you go through to a formalistic,

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,490
a very basic example is day to the Barberton, and let's say the mod is a very big integer one nine

115
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:33,970
platoon.

116
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,000
That's OK, it multiply.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,560
OK.

118
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,140
But these children will not be one, it will be zero, because right now emerging things are multiplying

119
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,850
late initially to zero.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,750
Yes, sir, I've got 20 and let's see about 20.

121
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,950
I know the march or not, because you're doing your 20s party again, branding you 20 will be 400.

122
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,410
I hope you understand this part.

123
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,670
Now let's do the modelling part again.

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,290
The same thing they're doing is to go through and place it whenever it exceeds my MA limit.

125
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,230
Let's dig more similarly, as you go straight into it air and whenever it suits me more limited, let's

126
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,830
take it.

127
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,630
Oh, let's dig marred by the.

128
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,800
Well, why am I doing this, why wounded exceed my long, long range?

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,780
Because very, very ultra long lines that I'm just adding it to resulting great so retreating is becoming

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:45,090
resulting, plus a look at both resultant and E alleged intent to devote 15.

131
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,660
Because I am continuously taking more.

132
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,430
If if you want to exceed their level 15, I'm going industry taking more rate.

133
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,170
If I add both of them, then what will be the range around 10 to the above 16?

134
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,080
In the worst case, if I had to integers of tangible 15 days in the worst case, they can go end the

135
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,680
worst 16.

136
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,860
But the standard 16 is easily storable in my data, in my long longing.

137
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,860
Easily storey buildings, because we are just adding two integers and again, part the second operation,

138
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,970
it's very easy.

139
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,450
We're not multiplying anything.

140
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,570
And so this is doing to.

141
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,780
Of course we're multiplying, but we can also write it as a plus equals to it.

142
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,850
And again, what I'm doing is I'm saying is going to be a blessing.

143
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,730
Again, I'm adding to Indonesia's of instead of.

144
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,110
So their total range will be less than 10 to the power 16.

145
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,830
And then when ultimately they will again become less than 10 to 15.

146
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,020
Why?

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,740
Because these less than 10 to the power 15 while taking more bases, they will again move back.

148
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:53,000
This is just to give you a brief idea about how does exponentially what is what is binary conversion

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,570
of a number?

150
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,820
How is this VI loop actually going?

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,720
So it's not about multiplication or only about exponents using this can be used in various places,

152
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,030
guys.

153
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,090
In the next topic, you will see what is metrics expert intuition in Dallas will be using the same thing.

154
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,390
I just wanted to give you a very.

155
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:22,030
Diverse obligation of binding and with it, so it's it isn't like binding members are a very big thing

156
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:30,210
and they're kind of if to the humanity, because everything that we see is working in binary, they

157
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,120
may been like under 200 years.

158
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,100
Everything works in condoms, which are not perfect binaries.

159
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,750
But yes, right now this is possible because of binary, right?

160
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,740
And yeah, so see in the next word, gays, thank you.
