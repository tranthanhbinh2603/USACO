Hi Everyone, in this lecture we're going to talk about the pigeonhole principle but again, it's a very

00:05.690 --> 00:11.060
simple principle but sometimes it's very useful in solving competitive programming questions.

00:11.630 --> 00:13.700
So let's talk about pigeonhole principle.

00:14.270 --> 00:16.310
So it is based upon a very simple idea.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.020
And let's start with an example.

00:18.020 --> 00:23.210
Suppose we are given five pigeons and there are four pigeonholes. OK?

00:24.050 --> 00:28.620
And you start putting pigeons one by one into each pigeon hole.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.290
So what is going to happen. if you have five pigeons and you only have four holes

00:33.800 --> 00:35.690
And if you put this pigeon here.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.130
If you put this pigeon here.

00:37.130 --> 00:42.770
If you put this pigeon here, if you put this pigeon here then if you want to put this pigeon then

00:42.770 --> 00:44.060
this might

00:44.810 --> 00:47.800
one of the whole will contain at least two pigeons.

00:47.810 --> 00:48.050
OK?

00:48.590 --> 00:53.870
This is what is going to happen and you can see it is as obvious as it is.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.700
Then you will have one pigeon left and you can put it into any one of the pigeon holes.

00:58.730 --> 00:59.390
That means

01:00.770 --> 01:05.750
to conclude, when the number of pigeons is greater than the number of pigeonholes then there will

01:05.750 --> 01:11.290
be at least one pigeon hole with at least two pigeons. OK?

01:12.160 --> 01:14.990
That's that's the whole idea of a pigeonhole principle.

01:15.350 --> 01:18.500
And now you may ask, why do we need this?

01:18.530 --> 01:20.660
This is something that is very obvious.

01:21.320 --> 01:26.930
But yes, we will be using this simple concept to solve some interesting questions.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.350
Let me give you another example. Hair counting example.

01:30.820 --> 01:37.100
Let's say the amount of hair is expressed in terms of number of hair strands.

01:37.700 --> 01:46.460
The average human hair does about one lac fifty thousand strands of hair. assuming no human has

01:46.610 --> 01:48.770
more than one million strands of it.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.290
That is 10 lac. given the population of a city is let's say 30 million.

01:54.350 --> 01:56.330
OK, then definitely

01:56.330 --> 02:03.560
we can conclude that there would be many people who would have exactly the same number of hair on their

02:03.560 --> 02:03.740
head.

02:03.750 --> 02:12.650
OK, so very simple. we are saying OK. one million so anyone can have a hair in the range zero

02:12.650 --> 02:14.630
to one million on their head. OK?

02:15.410 --> 02:23.540
But if the number of people who are there in a city, they are in the range, let's say that 30 million

02:23.540 --> 02:25.070
ok so there are 30 million people.

02:25.730 --> 02:30.250
So each of these 30 million people needs to be clubbed into this bucket.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.740
So this is basically buckets. OK?

02:33.560 --> 02:39.500
We can say definitely a lot of people are going to have overlap and there will be many people who would

02:39.500 --> 02:41.930
have the same number of hair on their head.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.420
This is another way of, you can say

02:45.830 --> 02:48.680
it's just what way pigeonhole principal.

02:48.680 --> 02:54.650
ok So we are putting people into buckets where each bucket denotes the amount of hair on

02:54.650 --> 02:55.090
their head.

02:55.100 --> 02:55.460
OK?

02:56.360 --> 03:04.070
And that's all for this small introduction. and in the next lecture will start solving problems on pigeonhole

03:04.070 --> 03:04.640
principle.
