1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,640
I so in this lecture, we're going to solve this problem it.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,480
It's actually a pretty big problem.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,300
So I have written to somebody.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,570
The actual version is on the platform spot and let us try to go through the problem statement and try

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,760
to understand this question.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,270
So it says people have many ways to save money on accommodation when they're on vacation, OK?

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,150
One of these ways is to exchange house with other people, OK?

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,700
So instead of going to hotel, people want to exchange houses.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,790
So there is a group of people who want to travel around the world.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,660
They live in different cities and they can travel to other people's city.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,010
And use that house.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,770
Now they want to make a plan.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,820
For a destination for each person, there are two rules to which, despite all the people, should go

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,360
to one of the other people's cities.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,120
So if there are multiple cities.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,600
OK, that said, this person be one, it will go to some other city.

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,920
This person will do it may go to some other city.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,470
This is better than be treatment.

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,450
Go to some other city.

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,220
This is than before.

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,830
It may go to some of the city so that all people are able to exchange those who have them never go to

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,390
the same routine because they're not willing to share ours.

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:25,930
OK, so that means in the final output, there would be some kind of permutation among the people they

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,440
want to maximize some of people's travel distance.

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,740
OK, the total travelling distance should be maximized.

26
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,610
The travel distance is the distance between the city and the city he travels to.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,640
OK, so the entire distance traveled from source to a particular destination.

28
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:50,120
OK, that is known as the travel distance for a Person B and other entities.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,840
And did it end minus one I was going to give them?

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,420
The travelers always choose the shortest, but when traveling, this is something that we need to see.

31
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,020
OK.

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:11,980
So effectively what it is given there are entities, OK and did it and minus highways which are connecting

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,220
them.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,050
That basically means if you have three cities, then there are only two highways, OK, that means it

35
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,390
will be in the form of three.

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,100
It will not be a growth again.

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,820
So that means all that you can take.

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,950
It is a graph without a cycle.

39
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,100
OK, it's a graph without a cycle.

40
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,460
And that is also called as a tree.

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,780
The structure of the cities is in the form of the restructure.

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,950
So maybe the most it is here, here who go.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:53,460
So you're going to if you have one two three four five six seven seven cities and there are only six

44
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,940
cities.

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:03,480
OK, so any anything that follows this kind of a structure, it is a graph without a cycle.

46
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:10,490
Look, if you add the edge like this, then it will violate this property that did and minus one is

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,640
in this case, you have neighbors, so this edge should not be there.

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,130
Now what is the meaning of the shortest possible path to get an ideal condition that is given to us

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,370
is they always take the.

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,130
Shortest possible, but.

51
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:37,410
While traveling, and second thing is we have to maximize the total distance we can maximize the total

52
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,230
distance off the road.

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,050
That effectively means if this person zero, if it wants to go to the Node two.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,880
It will take the direct route, it will not go go like this one possible way could be it's going to

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,470
go like this from zero.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,690
Well, this particular year, this is the shortest.

57
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,350
OK.

58
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,680
It will not do something like this, that it first goes to the Note eight and then it comes back, OK?

59
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,340
This is not how you're going to maximize the but.

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,960
You're going to take the shortest route.

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,730
But the distance might be maximized if you choose a different note.

62
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:24,920
Zero traveled from this node to maybe just note in that case, it is possible that it covers more distance

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,260
because this is how you need to maximize the total distance.

64
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,900
And I hope you also understood what is the meaning of shortest possible.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:43,460
But so let us discuss the rest of the statement and they want to maximize the total distance travelled.

66
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,760
The travel distance is a distance between the city and distance traveled to.

67
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,260
All right.

68
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,610
And we have already seen, given the highways information, it is your job to find out the maximum total

69
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,340
travel distance of all people that it would need to find out.

70
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,740
And then what?

71
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,880
We are given the number of best guesses.

72
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,360
OK.

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,880
East-West Good contains two integers and the number of it is followed by PN minus one lines, which

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,790
denote the city ex the city by.

75
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,480
And the land of diving.

76
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,680
So these are basically nodes and edges.

77
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,220
OK.

78
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,050
And here we are given how many sorties we have in this particular test case, and this is a number of

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,670
excuses.

80
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,980
Alright, so let us look at the input example one, so in the input example and what we have, we have

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,800
four cities.

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,440
Let's call them as 81, 82, 83 and 84.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:57,200
If you look carefully now from one to two, there is an edge that contains a distance of what.

84
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,460
It contains a distance the.

85
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,050
So this edge is of distance.

86
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,070
Three, then there is also an edge between.

87
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,130
The note to entry this is Outdistance two.

88
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,550
There is alternate between three and four, which is also of distance.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,740
So this is two, this is two, and now we need to see what is the maximum possible distance that all

90
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,660
the travels can travel.

91
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,140
So one way is if we just exchange these two, if I exchange one and two.

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,110
OK, the person one goes here, the person to go, is it the person three?

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,410
Was it the person forgoes it?

94
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,370
In this case, the total distance traveled would be three blustery or one and less two plus two.

95
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,880
That is how much the entry is X and four.

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,020
This is 10 units, OK?

97
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,480
But the answer is 18, because this is not the best way of arranging.

98
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,170
No, this is not the way that will maximize the total travel look.

99
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,070
So let us look at another way.

100
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,910
So, yeah, this is this is three, this is two, and this is to another, if would be, let us exchange

101
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,340
one word for.

102
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,260
And let us exchange two with three, that means this person comes here and this person comes here.

103
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,800
This person comes here and this person goes it.

104
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
So what would be the total distance traveled by person?

105
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
One, It would be three plus two plus two.

106
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,250
And similar distance traveled by Ford, so we can do twice of it between two and three.

107
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,000
We will travel distance two and three will also travel distance.

108
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,040
So this is for this is how much.

109
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,930
This is 14.

110
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,970
So 14 plus foot is what this is.

111
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,300
18.

112
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,530
So you're going to in this case, the answer is 18.

113
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,820
OK?

114
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,750
Another possible way could we exchange one with three?

115
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,750
OK, one comes to today's location and two it goes to four locations.

116
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,050
In this case, the total distance I will be right off, one goes to three.

117
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,140
So it is three plus two.

118
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,860
It is five.

119
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,580
There it is.

120
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,500
It goes to four, which is like this twice our foot.

121
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,180
This is also fine.

122
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,310
This distance is also 10 plus eight.

123
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,909
So one of so there can be multiple possible combinations which are leading to the same output.

124
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,270
But we are interested in the final output.

125
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,400
Instead of finding out the combination, we need to find out.

126
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,030
The final output.

127
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,450
OK, so now let us see how we can approach this particular problem.

128
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:03,370
OK, so let's discuss and approach that will help us to solve this particular question, OK?

129
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,850
So one one thing is clear the value of A. Large OK, we cannot find out all possible permutations of

130
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,880
nodes and then try to find out their distance.

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,180
OK?

132
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,130
The graph may be complex graph.

133
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,000
OK, we don't know.

134
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,130
OK, so now.

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,000
One thing we know is not the total distance, OK, the total distance.

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:37,500
Travel would be nothing, but it would be let's see if the edges are like this, if the edges are.

137
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,060
If the do that, even if the entity E4 and so on.

138
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,180
OK, then the total distance would be nothing but.

139
00:09:52,510 --> 00:10:04,390
Some constraints even and when times even plus and two times you do less and three times E3 and so on.

140
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,660
OK.

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,920
So total distance would be nothing, but it would be weighted sum of.

142
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,520
They did some of it is.

143
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,380
This everyone agrees, and what we need to figure out is we already know the Atlantic, we know even

144
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,330
if that as given in the input.

145
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,370
What we don't know is how many times each edge would be used.

146
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,170
OK, we need to find out what are the values of and one and two and three.

147
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:42,470
And these values should be such that they follow the consensus and they should be able to maximize these

148
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:49,220
in one and two and three should be equal to the maximum number of people.

149
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,200
That will travel.

150
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:02,850
Through the adage that will travel through that edge, if we are able to find out what is the maximum

151
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,460
number of people that will travel through that edge, we can easily find evidence.

152
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,650
By taking this, we did so OK.

153
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,980
The question is how do we find out how many people are going to travel through a particular age?

154
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,250
OK?

155
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,860
Now let me try to figure this thing out.

156
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,390
How we're going to do it?

157
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,870
Let us talk about a particular edge to this edges eatery.

158
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,060
I want to find out what should be the value of entry.

159
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,630
That means how many people will actually travel through this edge.

160
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,380
OK, and we want to maximize that.

161
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,030
So this edge breaks over graph or the three into two parts.

162
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,090
So one part is clearly visible.

163
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,500
OK.

164
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,490
The one part of this one?

165
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,750
Let me just Margaret Green.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,930
So this is one part of the graph.

167
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,010
OK.

168
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,270
Let me read this part one and let me read it as part two.

169
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,110
OK.

170
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,580
Let me know.

171
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,300
That's part.

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,150
Now, if you look carefully, what is going to happen, how many what do you think, how many people

173
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,370
will travel through this particular age?

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,470
How many people will travel through this particular age effectively?

175
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,960
We have five percent in this part a b, c d e f.

176
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,390
So we have six percent here, OK?

177
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,890
We have six persons in this graph in this part, and we have three persons in this part.

178
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,020
OK, maybe some JJ.

179
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,430
Now, what is going to happen?

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:48,300
OK, so I want maximum people should travel, so if I want to maximize the use of this edge, I would

181
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,840
be sending maximum people from part one to part two.

182
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,980
And I will be sending maximum people from part to part one.

183
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,910
OK, if I want to maximize the use of every age to now, one thing is very clear that if I try to send

184
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,700
all six people back to work again, I send six people to buy two from part one.

185
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,670
The answer is no, because part two has only three transit is available.

186
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,320
OK, there are only three rooms or transit is available there that can accommodate at most it even.

187
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,320
OK.

188
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,810
So I cannot send six people in part two.

189
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,790
I cannot send four people in part two, but I can send three people in part.

190
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,900
OK, that means.

191
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:37,020
And similarly, since three people are coming here, I can send three people from here as well.

192
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,470
OK.

193
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,910
So what is the number of people that would be traveling through this particular age?

194
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,390
OK.

195
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,700
Some I think that would be nothing but a minimum of.

196
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,960
I sense in part one, OK?

197
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,540
And part two and twice of it drives off it.

198
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:09,440
It is nothing but the window minimum of this is what this is six.

199
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,110
This is three and this is nothing but two into three.

200
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,540
Effectively, in the best case or in the maximum case, there would be six people who would be using

201
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,560
this edge to travel from one part of the graph to another part.

202
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,970
If you do this thing for all ages, then you will get these coefficients.

203
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,610
And you can easily find out the way it did.

204
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,150
OK.

205
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,190
So if this very dense led to forward, then this edge would be contributing six in 2004, that is 24

206
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,890
in Dover, and we will add 24 to your answer.

207
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,310
OK.

208
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,800
So I hope this part is it and that this this is what where we have used the the general principle.

209
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:01,820
OK, so effectively on the right, we have three holes, but we have six regions, so only three parents

210
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,530
can travel to these three holes.

211
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:10,190
OK, and three three three regions from here will travel to these three holds, OK.

212
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,010
So it does not matter where they are traveling to.

213
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,070
The only thing that matters is how many times they would be using this edge, OK, how many times this

214
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,660
edge is being used?

215
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,230
And we will do it for all ages, and this will effectively help us find out the total.

216
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,800
And I will call this approach as a greedy approach.

217
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,890
We are kind of finding the local maxima.

218
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,490
OK.

219
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:42,620
And so we are finding multiple local maximums and adding the answer for all that is OK.

220
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,450
So if you want me to drive around on the give an example, we can do it.

221
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:57,320
So let's say this is a this is B, this is C and this is D, OK now, along with this dry run, I would

222
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,270
be discussing the implementation aspect as well, or we can implement it.

223
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,080
OK.

224
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,630
So one way is you break the graph around every page and then you say, OK, I will.

225
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,910
I will do what the DFS on this part.

226
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:18,830
OK, so if you do all the affairs on this bond and you do whatever's on this, but it's you get the

227
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,920
size of the first part one, the size of the second part is three.

228
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,130
And then you say again, this edge lenders three.

229
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,510
So I will.

230
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,300
A minimum of one entry multiplied with two.

231
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,920
Multiplied with three.

232
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,630
OK, this is the weight of debt.

233
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,990
This is because twice the number of people will travel twice of the minimum and this is the minimum.

234
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,530
OK, so this minimize kind of coming from the general.

235
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,290
So we can do this.

236
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,860
This is going to contribute to how much it's going to contribute one into two into three.

237
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,480
That means six units.

238
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:58,180
OK, but what is going to happen for the other edge that we also need to figure it out?

239
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,580
So what we are going to do is.

240
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,510
So this we know that this edge will contribute six units.

241
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,810
So let us talk about the complexity of this approach.

242
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:15,430
So we are doing DFS that takes a lot of time and we are doing doing it for every edge, so multiplied

243
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:22,569
with it again and the E squared plus, even though it may not pass all the test cases.

244
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,800
So let me discuss a slightly efficient implementation of doing the office.

245
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,520
So what we are going to do, we are going to traverse this graph edge badge.

246
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:34,870
OK.

247
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,050
So let's say we start from this edge.

248
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,390
This is having a very of three, this is having a bit of two, this is that angry enough to bother you,

249
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,980
but I was this edge in Mexico alone.

250
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,080
And you ask me, OK, give me the size of the subsidy that is below you.

251
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
So be Bivol again of us on it.

252
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,910
It will make a call on see, and we will again relative as on its own.

253
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,240
It will run a deficit once we run the affairs on the does not have any neighbors that are not visited,

254
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,820
they will return or get my XYZ is one.

255
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,330
OK.

256
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,400
This had just visited so that one.

257
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,820
Once this, I just visited what we can do, we will start building a transit from this edge.

258
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,010
OK, because we are coming back.

259
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:29,120
Now what we know is we have a node CE and it has a charity D, so details its parent.

260
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,520
OK.

261
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,190
I have only one person inside this entire sub.

262
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,540
That means.

263
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,090
How many nodes you have in the rest of the tree?

264
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,540
How many nodes you have in the rest of the tree, that is nothing, but if one not, is it?

265
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,000
The rest of the tree will have n minus one.

266
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,250
And what is the minimum of these two?

267
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,530
That is nothing but one.

268
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
OK, so a minimum of one.

269
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,690
And or minus one that is three into two into the weight of this edge.

270
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,820
That is how much this this, this adds, is going to contribute four units to the answer.

271
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,120
OK?

272
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,870
All right now from see, we're going to go back and we are saying what you see is also one note the

273
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,490
sea is going to tell its parent that I actually have two nodes here, OK?

274
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:26,200
And if you have two nodes in this sub, the remaining the three, the remaining sub three is also going

275
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,740
to have.

276
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,270
It just lost a leg on.

277
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,720
So we just lost their diagram, so.

278
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:46,030
Let us let us recap what we were doing, so we said we will try to break between this edge, so we will

279
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,340
figure out how many people will travel travel through this edge, so it would be a minimum off.

280
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,940
On the left side, there is one person on the right side that are three percent rise of it multiplied

281
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,060
with the weight of it, it would be two into one into three.

282
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,840
That is six.

283
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,150
We said we will try to break it for this edge.

284
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:05,770
OK.

285
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,090
Then there are two persons in this part.

286
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,590
There are two wasn't in this, but it would be twice into a minimum of two into two multiplied with

287
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,520
the attachment that is two.

288
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,860
So it would be two in two to four into two eight eight units.

289
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,320
And if we try to break this edge, so there is one one one or two and there are three nodes, it it

290
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,310
would be the window minimum of one entry multiplied with what?

291
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,030
So it would be again at 3:40.

292
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,240
So this is 12+ +6, that is 18.

293
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,220
So you can divide still getting the right answer.

294
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,640
18.

295
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:51,190
But now the question is how you can do the DFS that we were discussing effectively what happened in

296
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,970
the offices?

297
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,790
Let me just pick a different marker.

298
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,420
So what happened is a miracle on me.

299
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:08,240
OK, we made a call on C, C Miracle on D, and it does not have any better details.

300
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,280
See, OK, I am.

301
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,870
I am a single note, so we get to know one of the values is one, OK?

302
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,800
From this note, we get to know if you're talking about this edge.

303
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,870
Then what happens?

304
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,860
So this child basically returns of illusion because it is returning the size of this entry.

305
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,290
It becomes one, followed by n minus one.

306
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,430
So n minus one is and is what for four, minus one is three.

307
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,790
So we get to know this value and we multiplied with two.

308
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,700
And we also know the advert is two.

309
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,100
So we get to know this answer that is four.

310
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,140
So I'd see this.

311
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,890
Is this a three?

312
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,080
And he says, OK, whatever is the size of the child three, I will add one to it.

313
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,640
I will return to my parent.

314
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,300
So she returns to to the parent.

315
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,640
It becomes to a minimum of two and minus two.

316
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,340
OK, what is the size of this?

317
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,800
So that is an adequate and minus two.

318
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,020
That is two multiplied with the agent.

319
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,700
That is two.

320
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,790
So it becomes too intolerant to do that, is it?

321
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,220
So we effectively get the answer for this rule.

322
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:19,180
The night three, we get to know the size of the subsidy is what it does to we are one do it.

323
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,700
It becomes doing to a minimum of three comma and minus three.

324
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,680
That is one into three.

325
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,130
This ad is now three.

326
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,230
So it becomes went to 3.6.

327
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:39,030
So we again get this one and we say, OK, this sum is what this sum is nothing but 18.

328
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,880
So effectively what we are doing is we are doing our depth first search and from every child node,

329
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,060
we are returning the size of the Sabry.

330
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,900
OK.

331
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:57,490
So both you have a complex tree like this in this case, if you make a call, if you make a call.

332
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,010
Here.

333
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,130
OK, if you make a call here, it will automatically make a call here, head hit and this so will return

334
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,430
as a tree to its spirit.

335
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:06,750
OK.

336
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,870
And we want to see how many times this edge is being used.

337
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,830
We'll find out the minimum of three and how many nodes are there in the other part of the tree.

338
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,630
That is nothing but n minus three.

339
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,780
OK?

340
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,880
We are not using the first to find out that bad because we know the total nodes.

341
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,650
If Tree are in one part, the other part is going to contain and minus three and we are taking this

342
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,360
minimum because.

343
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,770
We cannot fit a larger number of people into a small, smaller number of cities.

344
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,440
OK, so that's why we are taking minimum and that's nothing but an obligation of business.

345
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,470
OK, so I hope now you understood.

346
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,940
So what we have to do is we have just do the office in a single pass.

347
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,690
And while doing the office, you have to keep track of.

348
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,550
These values and this will take overall complexity of order off.

349
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,340
We see that as linear anything.

350
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,940
OK, so that's all for this lecture and thank you.
