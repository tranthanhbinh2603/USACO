1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:09,180
Um, to finish this section about the device, we learned how to use this first to verify undirected

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,880
graphs to verify if there's a cycle in undirected graph.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,720
We enter this section by learning about the EJU classification, which helps us to learn how to effectively

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,650
learn if there is a cycle in a directed graph or not using the office.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,870
In the next section, we'll learn about the topology concert and we will learn an easy way to figure

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,230
it out.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,240
Also cycles in directed graphs.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,380
So let's see.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,980
So far, we learned about this cycle detections using undirected graphs.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,820
But when we try to implement and think about that for that directed graphs, we notice that the Vista

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,190
array isn't enough and we give an example in the homework for that and the homework solution.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,660
Notice see here in the in in in, uh, in in.

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,590
It is a problem, we have a vested note.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,390
But the key problem is we do know.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,470
We do not know if this new is part of a cycle or not.

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,310
That's why we were confused the visit information wouldn't do enough.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,100
When you look to their lifting graph here, you will notice that not zero one two two one one two two

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:24,730
two zero one two harvested two now is trying to go back to zero zero is a cycle now here.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,310
This is creating a cycle and we can see that zero is actually an ancestor of two because there is a

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,150
bus from here to here, but there is actually bus from two to zero.

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,360
So I am and sister for you and your ancestor.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
For me, this is cycle.

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,050
In the second case, zero winter, two, one winter to two.

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,930
And all of them harvested now zero is an ancestor of two.

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,210
Then now we are trying to start again to two from zero to two two is again vested.

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,700
But this time the information is is as it is.

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,370
Zillow is still insisted for two zero still and still for two and two is descendant of zero.

28
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,400
So this is in a cycle.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,270
This is a problem that happened with the device in directed graph.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,580
Both of cases are vested.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,770
This time, zero has a cycle.

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,980
Really, this time two doesn't have a cycle, so we know that the Vista array wasn't enough.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,270
This means the note could be vested and can belong to more than one case in the recorded graphs.

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,970
And this takes us to a very new topic, which is age classification.

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,620
Now remember, this is a defense first three if you have a tree, if they face an undirected graph,

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,390
you end up with this deficit tree, which also exist in a directed graph.

37
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,110
We call this kind of this bolded it here.

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,770
We call them tree edges, and the tree edges are the edges that our.

39
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:11,640
The school used it, used it to navigate this ones that are dotted here, we ignored them because they

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,950
were four nodes that were visited already.

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,750
OK, now let's proceed more.

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,130
Let's do this first, this three.

43
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,660
We start at zero.

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,880
We go to one, go to two.

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,340
Good one, good, the two good to three to six so far, so good.

46
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,110
While doing this sort of kitchen, we will ignore the two zero edge because this vested will ignore

47
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,530
three one, because it is vested will ignore one two six because there's vested.

48
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,790
So these are the three edges that we have this one here, this one here.

49
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,010
This one here.

50
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,540
This one here.

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,740
All the other will be cancelled, then we will start from four.

52
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,430
And also this will be cancelled, this will be cancelled and this one would be used.

53
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,800
This bolded one are there.

54
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,650
Three edges.

55
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,920
And we have a lot of cancelled the edges.

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,630
There are, in fact, when you study them, there are three cases for this see.

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,020
Cancel the aegis.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,510
OK, now I want you to remember the following we have two separate defense.

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,600
The first, the first of zero, ended up with zero one two three six and the second the effects of war

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,730
ended up between four and five.

61
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,800
Also, observe this three edges here that we will cancel them.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,460
They actually went between the nodes of the single defense.

63
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,500
This edge that were cancel the year would actually, from our defense nodes to alter their first nodes

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,620
like four to two, for example, would clarify that a little more now.

65
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,130
In graph theory, we can classify the edge of a directed graph to four types.

66
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,840
The first case is a three edge.

67
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,600
This is the one that we learned before.

68
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,380
This is the one that built the first three four four four subgraph.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,560
Specifically, when we check the Node V. we noticed that V is unvisited.

70
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,620
So we use its edge and we call it a diff is it's the we call it a three h.

71
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,990
Now, if if it happens that the vista of V is true, we have three cases for that.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,960
Gives no one is what we call a forward edge.

73
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,130
And in this case, you is an ancestor of the.

74
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,640
In that year versus three.

75
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,580
Don't forget, this segment will be confused.

76
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,470
You is an ancestor of V in the current DFAC tree.

77
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,300
We will see an example.

78
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,630
And this happened within the same single day for.

79
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,920
The second case, which actually creates cycles.

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,450
We discover that V is an ancestor of you in the deficit tree and you is also an ancestor of V.

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,150
So zero to one, for example, and one go to zero.

82
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,290
This is like we call them back ages the third.

83
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,420
The case, which we call the cross age you is neither any sister nor descendant of V.

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,790
They do not have a relationship and this happen in two cases, either within a single day physical.

85
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:37,900
Or in between multiple different schools, remember, previously we have the zero one, two, three

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,390
six in a diverse school and then we have the four or five in a call and we observed that Ford wanted

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,030
to go to two two is in the previous day for school.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,310
So this is a cross.

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
It is crossing things.

90
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,210
Let's see a visualization for that.

91
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,570
It is a graph that we just, uh, drawn.

92
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,980
Remember, the difference is zero cover only zero one two three six.

93
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,270
Now.

94
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,560
This black edges are the three edges.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,260
This I have coloured problems, this let me call it orange, this orange edge is back.

96
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,650
It will carry cycle zero one two zero one two zero one two.

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,340
This is creating Cycle one two three one two three one two three.

98
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,240
Zero, six and one six, we call them forward the edge.

99
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:34,270
Look, in the first three one is an ancestor of six in there, the first the three.

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,910
What is the relationship between one and six?

101
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,940
One is ancestor of six.

102
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,550
Here I am.

103
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,410
Your parent, your big bird.

104
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,980
What is the relationship between zero and six in the deficit?

105
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,340
Three.

106
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,200
I am your ancestor.

107
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,530
Now look to.

108
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,450
These two edges here and to.

109
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,290
In the deficit three, there is no relationship between four and two, so it is neither ancestor nor

110
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,190
descendant for it.

111
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,450
This is across age.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,220
This is across age and I like it more when it comes from civil defense codes because this is a separate

113
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,810
the fiscal and it's going to cross to the second if history making like a connection to it.

114
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,180
If you don't remember the point of the deficit three, you will keep thinking.

115
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,440
But food is built to two, but food is built into two to know we have to face up to.

116
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,650
We have zero one two three six is a defense, three we have four and five is a deficit.

117
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:32,990
Three.

118
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,700
You build the relationship of who is the ancestor of whom in their defense.

119
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,110
Three.

120
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,420
Please don't move beyond this slide before understanding these four types.

121
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,160
Look, how can we determine the ages?

122
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:58,080
This is take us to the second think relevant to the um relevant to the age classification, which is

123
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,910
timing the timing.

124
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,550
The note is simply giving the time for the new data to started processing and time when we finish the

125
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,910
processing as simple as we could here to erase, one of them is started and another is finished initialized

126
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,600
to minus one.

127
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,730
And this is our defense good.

128
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,670
When we start, we give it time here.

129
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,790
Then we commit to the time, then do our recursion once our recursion finished.

130
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,610
We assign the current to finish time and then we increment to the time here.

131
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:39,480
Not that this time is incrementing through the other notes with simple comparisons, we can know their

132
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,720
age type of the three cases, the easiest.

133
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,480
The case is coming for the forward, the age, which are mainly if the sort of started of a who is this,

134
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,620
then it started off enable.

135
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,760
This must be forwarded.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,270
The challenging one the second two cases is it across age or back age?

137
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,820
If you open the sailors book, you will find some comparison between the rules that can answer it.

138
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
But I will show you an easier way here.

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,060
Let's proceed.

140
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,950
I am auditing now the graph with the finish and the starting time.

141
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,870
So we started by not zero.

142
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,510
So starting is one, then moved here.

143
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,370
Start to move here, start the three moved here, start to four, moved here.

144
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,200
Start to five.

145
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,700
Then this would finish to finish is six.

146
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,500
This not finished vision seven.

147
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,750
Finish eight finish nine.

148
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,680
Finished 10.

149
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,850
Then we start the Note 11 for here at 11.

150
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,950
Then we started this at 12th.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,360
Finish at 13.

152
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,740
Finish at 14.

153
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:47,580
Now, let's compare the starting times of things compare, for example, the Note zero with the Note

154
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,030
six.

155
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,680
You will notice that the start of zero is this, then it started off six.

156
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,910
This means while we are and say the difference recursion, this means that this must be for the edge

157
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,180
because I started before you am now reaching you.

158
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,960
And now reaching you zero.

159
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,280
Go this cycle to six.

160
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,410
First, then.

161
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,790
Now it tries to go from here within the defense called within the defense call.

162
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,590
Within the defense call.

163
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,380
So the rule is this morning as a starting time, which is a smaller than you.

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,780
It means I am forward for you.

165
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,960
OK.

166
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,950
What about if you if you if you thought about this note, it is starting after the finish of the last

167
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,530
year, so it's a start time in a way it isn't.

168
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,480
Before that, let's do some comparison.

169
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,100
Let's see the problem.

170
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,790
What is the problem?

171
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,180
It's two zero.

172
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,080
It's two and the zero here.

173
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,220
When you compare the start of two and zero, it would be greater than.

174
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,600
And this is cycle.

175
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,430
And if you compare it to Darfur and the two, it would be greater then, but this is a motorcycle.

176
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,410
So we can summarize that is following from comparison of the sorting.

177
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:10,440
If a start of a is less than a start of gee, this means this must be forward to each and I hope you

178
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,840
can see the logic I am coming to you.

179
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,520
I started earlier and now coming back for you again.

180
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,020
You must be my child.

181
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,400
Migrant, the child.

182
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:28,770
But we can see that the started relationship doesn't help with the cycle or not cycle cycle for baggage

183
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,670
and not cycle for the cross edge.

184
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,420
So now we need a smarter way to handle this.

185
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,010
Two things now here.

186
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,210
Let's see, how can we do that?

187
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,640
This is a question here.

188
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,790
What what really makes a big edge?

189
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,320
What really create the cycle?

190
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:53,920
Think here if we started from the physical move to the fist one two and then trying to go to zero?

191
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,620
What makes really zero is a cycle.

192
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,800
The answer is as following four zero to cause a cycle, it must be my ancestor.

193
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,480
This means it is active in this that cools.

194
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,050
It is active in the state.

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,930
So this means zero in the stack is squatting.

196
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:20,280
One one in the stack is going to do in the stack is calling zero zero is active in the stack codes.

197
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,290
That's why it is causing a problem.

198
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:30,600
Remember the second the case, the early graph, we drew zero going to one going into two and zero going

199
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,020
to zero one two would be active in the stack.

200
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,040
Then two will go down one, it will go down now.

201
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,310
Zero will try to now to access two again.

202
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,210
Two isn't in the stack cool, so the active roster could refer to who are all of my current ancestor.

203
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:56,430
So if religion is going zero one two three six zero one two three, our ancestors of four six because

204
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,620
they are active in this, their codes.

205
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,510
So all what remains to figure out if this visited node?

206
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,450
Is it part of the stack calls or not?

207
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,360
We can trivially know that from the finished.

208
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,120
Of the nude in the nude, is it still finished equal minus one?

209
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,780
It means that we never finished it and is still active in the state court.

210
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,260
And with this way, we can figure it out in a trivial way.

211
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,610
If the nude is actually gross or not, I hope you got it, OK?

212
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,790
Thus, think I showed you before the cross edge between toes to couple of defense?

213
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,660
I want to show you the cross edge within a single device.

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,670
First of all, look to this simple example here zero one to the wreckage and glass following zero.

215
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,630
Go to the next EJU.

216
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,740
It's one one go to two, which is to then return the kid.

217
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,460
Zero.

218
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,570
Find itself going to two, but the start of zero is less than the start of two, which means zero started

219
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,010
before me, which confirms I'm still your ancestor, so everyone is happy.

220
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,780
This is a case of forward age.

221
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,150
The second case is zero to one.

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,800
Then come back.

223
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,960
Zero good two, two two tries to go to one.

224
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,540
One is vested.

225
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,740
Now this is across age.

226
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,320
This is across age.

227
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,350
So as you see, this is an example of across age within the single DFS could.

228
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,450
Yeah, your.

229
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,090
I would like you to modify the school to find the cycles I would like to leave this implementation for

230
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,730
you used to arrays started and finished, your code should help with the class of each age.

231
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,780
You will just add three symbol condition.

232
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't go beyond that.

233
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,090
I would like you to try as a sample of the lecture, the lecture segments.

234
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,590
Please compare your code.

235
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,580
I'm attaching my good.

236
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,590
Don't worry, you will know the right answer.

237
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,720
The first thing I would like to tell you in that if the graph we don't have for the ages and we don't

238
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,530
have Chris Hedges, we only have a three edge or back edge.

239
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,180
That's why if you find the note visited, you know that it is a cycle.

240
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,760
If you if you have entries to see formal proof, you can find it in the syllabus book.

241
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,220
This lecture was a bit heavy.

242
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,280
You need to view maybe two or three times.
