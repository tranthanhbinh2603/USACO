00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,300
Let me comment on the.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,880
Let me comment on the direct case, I asked, could you in the problem to think about the graph of the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,440
charity case?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,570
So let's say you have this very simple graph.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,640
Three nodes of three edges, British symbol.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,640
Uh, if let's say that occasion started and go from zero to one, so now zero is marked as visited,

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,950
one is marked as visited, one go to do two market has visited occasion, go back on occasion, go back.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,830
Then zero goes to to find it visited.

9
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,050
You think, Oh, this is a cycle, but there is no cycle.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,990
This is the great difference between directed and the director graph in the undirected graph.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:53,570
Zero one two zero zero two one one go to two to go to the zero by itself, so find it visited.

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,900
Then there's a cycle in the directed graph when the recursion go back and zero, go try the two and

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,420
find it that you cannot consider it as a cycle.

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,750
That's the big difference between the two cases here.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,990
So the cycle detection in undirected graph is pretty straightforward, but in the directed graph it's

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,550
a bit more complex than that.

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,530
And I didn't like we didn't talk yet.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,880
How can we handle that?

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,910
And if you would like to really recognize the condition to figure out the cycle in that in the cycle,

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,530
in the deleted graph, it isn't just about being visited or not.

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,630
It is about the activist tech.

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,120
Like, let's say we are not zero, then let's say here, let's say that this is directed graph, but

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,350
they actually the edges this way.

24
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,880
Zero one two Recursion So the stack now has zero and one or two.

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,880
And to try to go to zero zero is in the stack and the act, of course.

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,650
So this zero must be in a cycle.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,470
Now let's say here the the opposite case.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Let's say we are at zero one two and here now the decision to start at zero one and two, so the stack

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,670
is zero one or two.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,750
And then the decision go back to to go to back to one, so the decision one and two go out of the stack

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,540
now zero tries to go to two, which is vested, which means you do not have to make again the decision,

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,470
but it is in the stack only if it is in the stack.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
You can figure out it's this, like it or not, which a bit like it looks like more complicated for

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,450
you, you know?

35
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,760
But in a way, I just wanted you to figure out the difference between them.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,110
So one way to know about the cycles is what we call the topological sort.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,170
Topological sort is one way to know there are cycles or not in directed graph.

38
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,520
Yeah, that's a.
