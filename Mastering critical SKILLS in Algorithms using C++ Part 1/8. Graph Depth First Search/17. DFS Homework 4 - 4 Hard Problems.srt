1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,880
Homework, no food in the defense, it's a bit hard compared to others.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:15,000
So the first one is is is a by Patricia de Bipartite is a very well known, is a very well known, uh,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,160
probability in graphs.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,130
It's very important.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,060
The problem is actually no thought.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,450
Just it might be a little bit in thinking twice, but eventually pretty simple and pretty direct.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,560
So the bar graph is as following we have vertices.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,720
So let's see here the examples.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,070
We have a graph like this graph and we can like virtually split the graph to two groups the group number

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,290
one and group number two.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:49,620
And here is the probability there are no edges between the nodes in the same group, and edges are only

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,360
between both of them here.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,470
So you see the graph here like this is a very similar one.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,960
If we divided this graph to this group here and this group here, we need to verify two things.

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,550
Within the group, there are no edges, as you see.

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,600
There is no such edgy energy here or an edge here between the groups we have edges.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,450
OK, so here in this one, um.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,220
So you see the color.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:26,200
Like, let's say this node and this node and this node and this node, the are the same color, black

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,560
color.

21
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,670
And the second one are red color.

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:36,790
So now let's see in the black group, do we see any any edges between nodes like these two are connected,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,320
not connected, not connected.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,530
Now in the red, the group in the same way these two are connected, not connected, but connected between

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,780
the two groups themselves, the red and black.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,250
We see the grouping here, so we see that this red is connected to this flag.

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,400
This red was this black say to this black and so on.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,770
It's actually people call it the two color.

29
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,350
And the problem, which means you would like to color the graph such that some graph are black, some

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,480
are white and you would like.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,420
There are no edges within the black group and there are no edges within the right red group.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,890
And there are edges between the black and red or the black and white.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,910
Whatever color gear so that this is following the graph is undirected.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,700
You will return it through if it is a bipartite graph, which means there is actually a way to split

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,240
it into two groups the G1 and G2, such that connections are only between G1 and G2.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,610
Feel free as a personal practice to even bring to their Group one and Group two nodes, which would

37
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,380
be which should be an easy task.

38
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,780
So this is mainly what is it by what that graph.

39
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,860
Here are some examples.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,480
So this is the first example.

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,000
The answer is false because there is no way to partition the nodes to two independents, such as Split.

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,720
What about this graph?

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:01,850
So here is one way if you took zero and two as the group number one and one of three as the second group,

44
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,200
as you see zero two, there are no edges between themselves, one of three.

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,110
There are no edges between themselves, but there are edges between the first group and the second group.

46
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:21,490
The second the problem, um, we have a graph, the graph looks like a tree.

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,330
Remember the tree that is a one bath between every two nodes in a three, right?

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,150
There can be no cycles in the city.

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,570
But the tree definition is actually undirected.

50
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
The definition notes actually a like like a tree.

51
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,650
But the edges actually have of their texture.

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,040
So.

53
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,710
So there will be like in the minus one edges only in this graph, and there are no direct cycles here.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,790
So now so they're given input is actually for air at three lake structure that is directed.

55
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,530
So connections here are directed digits and they will be exactly in the minus one.

56
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,960
And here is the question.

57
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,700
Some of the notes here is not number zero, let's say this note.

58
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,910
We would like to be sure that there is there, Beth, from every note to nude numbers you.

59
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,780
There is a bath from every nude to nude numbers you, but we know that the original graph is direct.

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,860
So this isn't the case.

61
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:24,480
This is this following we would a change the direction of some of the ages such that there is a the

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,510
age from every nude to every other nude.

63
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,090
OK, so here is that in this graph, for example, here you see the black ones.

64
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,580
Here are that, uh, the the original edges, the original directed edges.

65
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,530
Now when you look at here, is there a bathroom two to 2.0?

66
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,580
You see that nozzle can go to three, but it cannot go further here.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,010
So if we change in the direction of this edge and the direction of this edge to be the opposite direction,

68
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:01,830
now no two can can reach zero and three and two once food can reach net zero already, but five cannot

69
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,400
because the edges here, so we will change in the direction of this.

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,520
EDIT2 So now we change at the edges.

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,410
The tusk is as follows You would like to change the minimum number of edges such that every node can

72
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,600
now reach the node number zero.

73
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,540
It is another example.

74
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,780
Number two cannot reach A. No.

75
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,260
Zero, if we change at this age, no two can reach zero.

76
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,640
Number three, was this a change you can reach No.

77
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:32,980
Zero.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,000
Look no further.

79
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,470
Anatsui change also this world.

80
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,400
So now it is.

81
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,380
We needed to not only to make the change.

82
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,970
Problem number three.

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,520
And this is the previous two of those problems, by the way, are OK, they are manageable.

84
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,830
This one is a bit hard and it involves two combined algorithms together.

85
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,370
You will not be able to solve this problem by just using the office.

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,460
There is actually one more trick you can find a hint in the early in the solution of this problem.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,740
So here is a task.

88
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,610
We have agreed to the metrics, and every cell has a value.

89
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,560
We are here at zero zero and would like to go to five and five.

90
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,200
Now the bullet as following were any birth we go, we compute the value.

91
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:31,270
The value represent that what we call the birth effort, the birth effort is defined as following.

92
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,160
It is the maximum absolute difference between any two consecutive values.

93
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,330
So let's see here this is know that both these two values, what is the absolute difference to these

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,810
two values?

95
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,480
What's the difference to this two values?

96
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,790
What is the difference two and here two?

97
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,580
So what is the maximum difference in all of these values?

98
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,510
The maximum is two.

99
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,010
So we see that the effort of this birth is to let's take another example.

100
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,040
Let's say we would like to go here, here, here, here, OK?

101
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,580
Remember would like to go from the top left to the bottom right now.

102
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,750
What is the difference here?

103
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,350
Just one.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,170
What does the difference here?

105
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,650
Six The difference here.

106
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,020
Six The difference here.

107
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,450
Three.

108
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,550
What is the maximum value in the bar?

109
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,000
Six.

110
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,570
So six.

111
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,760
They represented their effort of the Beth.

112
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:27,760
Our task is we would like to go from the top left to the bottom right with the minimum effort.

113
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,870
So your task is to decide what is the minimum effort to go from the top left to the bottom right.

114
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:42,610
So you should find the path that find the minimum effort the best that it's it's it's so absolute difference

115
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,100
is minimum, but is read the problem twice.

116
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,720
If you are confused about that, it is rather case if you would like.

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,580
If we go through this path, who would notice here every two values has a difference of only one.

118
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,880
So the maximum is one, and this is the best thing you can do here.

119
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,410
A third example here, if you go this way, this way, this way, you would notice that the maximum

120
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,110
difference is zero, which is the best thing you can do.

121
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,450
So this is merely the the task.

122
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,340
The first problem there is no alone judge for this problem.

123
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm not aware of a good problem.

124
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,420
The task is as following.

125
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,990
And actually, the implementation isn't the key in this problem.

126
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,200
You have undirected graph.

127
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,260
We'd like to return it true if it consists contains a cycle.

128
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,310
Remember, we did something that involves cycles before, right the matrix of problem.

129
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Remember, we already did that, but review this problem because it's the key for this problem here.

130
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,570
Now, you can assume for simplicity that the graph does.

131
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,590
It has any silver loops.

132
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,890
Does it?

133
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,910
Has anybody ages?

134
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,600
You would like to do the following.

135
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:04,100
Uh, you would like to implement the dysfunction bullion wood to check if the graph has a cycle or not.

136
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,740
Now here's the key in this problem I would like to provide an O V algorithm.

137
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,280
I would like you to informally prove the correctness of your algorithm.

138
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,520
So this is actually the key here, I don't just want you to write an algorithm to detect the second.

139
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,790
I need you to make sure it is all the algorithm and I need you to verify that it is all the algorithm.

140
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,550
Now, after you're done with that, I would like you to analyze a directed graph like you will not implement

141
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,180
something here.

142
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,850
You would just analyze, adapt the graph and tell me why your implementation here is in the U.S. will

143
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,350
fail on this directed problem.

144
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:50,210
The written graph You can develop a trivial graph of three nodes early that can show you why your graph

145
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,310
on their case will fit.

146
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,410
So only used to use three nodes and implement that, like a simple example that showed the failure of

147
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,570
it.

148
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,080
You don't need to good that, uh, will address the directed graph seconds later.

149
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:16,360
Uh, yeah, for the for the distinction, I'm providing you with a simple file that involves some artistic

150
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,690
pieces.

151
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,870
So the file structure would be following the first number two would be a number of cases.

152
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,250
Two means there will be two graphs, then the first number is the number of nodes and the number of

153
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,540
edges, then three edges.

154
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,070
They would be zero based indices.

155
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,320
So the graph is like as we used so far.

156
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,320
If the graph has a cycle, you will print.

157
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,010
No.

158
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,370
If it doesn't has a graph, it doesn't have a cycle you would print.

159
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,030
Yes.

160
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,980
So this is a fight.

161
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,030
That's all.
