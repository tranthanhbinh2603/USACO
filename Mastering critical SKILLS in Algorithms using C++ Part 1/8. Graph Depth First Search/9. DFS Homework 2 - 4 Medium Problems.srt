1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,500
Homework number two for the defense, so this homework is focusing mainly on how to make a defense on

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,100
a metrics.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,880
Don't get scared.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,150
The problems are in the throat.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,720
The first one is named the islands.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,060
So what's the sub island?

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:26,440
You will be given specifically two metrics metrics number one, grade one and the grade to the values

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,940
here, or just zeros and ones zero represent the promoter and one represent like a land.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,270
Now, the island is merely a group connected to funds in the four normal directions up, down the right

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,720
and left.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,150
So this is so far like the normal reachability we did.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,890
Now here is what we want to do.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,250
We would like it in an island, for the island, for an island in grade two.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,990
We would call it sub island if it is completely existent.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,530
Island one.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,020
So let's see an example here.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,010
This is great number one.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,260
And this is good number two.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,680
Now this one here has this Big Island has this island, this island, this is grid number one.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,660
For grid number two.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,360
When you look at it here.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,270
Consider this grid, for example, here.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,760
This one here.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,540
Is completely inside this one sexually identical.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,950
So this is a sub island.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,660
Now for this one.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,030
We see that it isn't inside any island from here.

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,070
So this one is an island.

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,820
This is an island by itself and this is another one.

30
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,370
They are in the Orange one island.

31
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,230
There are two islands.

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,470
This island, a subset of this island.

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,320
This island is a subset of this island.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,340
So overall, there are three islands here that are sub islands here.

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,140
As overall, this one has actually much more than that, like this is one island, this is second island,

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,510
this third island for Island five island.

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,660
So Great two has five islands, but only three of them are Sub Island here.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,890
So what should we do?

39
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,270
Is return the number of the sub islands that we have?

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,310
So this is this all.

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,590
Please read the description again if you are confused.

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:34,320
This is another example here we can see that this Big Island isn't part of this one, so it isn't counted.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,780
This island is part of this one.

44
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,860
This island is part of the same island here, so we have two islands that our islands from that one.

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,830
Problem number two, coloring a word.

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,940
You would be given a single matrix and a specific rule and the color and a specific color.

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,960
Each value in the grid represent a color, so think of the think of the color here, like if the given

48
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,200
grid is just an image like the footwell problem and the connectivity is exactly as we did in the flood,

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,530
the four directions.

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,610
Now we would like here.

51
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,620
We want to color the wool grid, as we did in the UM, as we did in the flood.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,080
For lecture, we will only color the border.

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,960
So what is the burden of a connected component?

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,270
It's actually given for you here as a definition.

55
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,650
The sill is a border in two cases, only the first case.

56
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,410
It's adjacent to a cell that isn't part of the current two component.

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,220
This is no.

58
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,260
One kiss number two, that the cell is actually a boundary agreed boundary, so on the grid boundary.

59
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,410
So maybe you will take this specific initial location, find the connected component, find the border

60
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,110
of the connected component and reshape it to the color.

61
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,060
There were the border just here.

62
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,840
Try to understand it in a normal way, like don't confuse yourself.

63
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,650
So to see here the examples we have a Matrix two by two.

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,450
The first value is one and one.

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,520
The second values is one and two.

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,860
Now it's, say, starting from zero zero.

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,030
So this is zero zero.

68
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,390
And then it asks you to recolor the boundary, the border only with three.

69
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,940
So this is actually the whole connected component.

70
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:36,100
As you see this three things all of them already are achieving the two conditions they are on the boundary

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,920
and they are even do not have a neighbor here.

72
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,320
The story this one has a different neighbor and this one has a different neighbor.

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,140
So this to here satisfy the two conditions this one.

74
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
That's why condition.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,340
But in a way, once in a while, one of them satisfied any condition.

76
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,180
It is border.

77
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,330
So this would be three and three and the three.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's see another example here we have two times the three matrix.

79
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,410
And we have one to two and we have two, three, two.

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,510
So it's a rosy colored one, so we are at it now.

81
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:21,390
Let's see where is my where is my, uh, my connected?

82
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,650
Compare this to here.

83
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,650
Now we would like to reconnect with the color three.

84
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,760
All of them would be exactly the same case here, so it would be three and the three and three.

85
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,830
So overall, one three three two three three.

86
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,120
This is a year Casimir in this case, the wool gray.

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,270
The wool matrix is just a bunch of ones, and let's make it here.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,010
One one, one one one one one one one.

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
Now it asks you for one one, so are at this one here.

90
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:58,190
Now let's find the converter to convert is all of this is now coloured with two.

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,630
All of them would be two.

92
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,400
Except this one, it would remain one here.

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,300
Why?

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,030
Because this one isn't the border.

95
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,530
It doesn't.

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,540
It isn't on the grid cell boundaries.

97
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,940
And it isn't.

98
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:17,210
It doesn't match any any that it doesn't touch any element that is out of the compound.

99
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,500
Here we understand it.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,280
If you look at it, you look at the examples that are given out very bad.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,500
So I think for you one more example here.

102
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,620
So we are given this grid here and we would like to find the border of this one here.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,400
Now, in terms of the connected component, we have all of that with us.

104
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,680
All of that was us.

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
All of that was us.

106
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,860
All of that was us.

107
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,730
All of that.

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,820
And that's here.

109
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,770
And also this to one here.

110
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,680
Now this is a connected components.

111
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,470
So which one of this connected component should be marketed should be the boundary?

112
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,360
So this one here?

113
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,130
All of these tools are neighbors for something that isn't in their connected computer, so they are

114
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,910
all boundaries.

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,920
This two also are matching none elements in the connected components.

116
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,680
All of these tools are at the grid boundary, so all of them are outside the connect component.

117
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,570
Now, this, too, is neighbor for this forward, so it's neighbor for a dude that is outside of the

118
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,380
community with us.

119
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,940
These two are at the boundary.

120
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,810
This one here.

121
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,170
Is enabled for this for it's also a boundary.

122
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:36,830
Now this, too, is the only one that isn't boundary because it's surrounding with normal values.

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:46,790
So, so as you see, if a cell is surrounded with four elements coming from its same component, it

124
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,910
is.

125
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,980
It isn't about the otherwise boundary.

126
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,420
The goods are there the boundary.

127
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,480
I hope you feel it like, you know, if this is a big sea.

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,890
And this is an island.

129
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,800
So we say that this is the outside one here.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,820
Israel is the boundary of the island, so this is a natural human concept.

131
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,860
This is the boundary of the island.

132
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,610
As you see, if this is the island, this is water.

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,390
So the boundary must be touching elements from outside the components.

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:27,340
And also here we have amended definitions, also touching there, touching the grid, the grid boundary

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,200
hidden, it's also a boundary.

136
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,830
So anyway, here are the two rules given by the problem statement.

137
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,870
Just apply them nothing.

138
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,770
Don't get yourself confused.

139
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,990
And theory the problem would like to count the number of closed islands.

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,310
So what defines Cruz Island is it's just following, first of all, the connectivity as we did before.

141
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,910
All of them are connected this way in this problem.

142
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,680
They flipped.

143
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,280
So zeros are the ends and ones out of the water.

144
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,450
So this problem, you ignore the ones and you depend on the zeros.

145
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,360
So now let's say we found seven connected components the close.

146
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:12,040
The island is an island that is surrounded totally by other nodes, by other values, which is once

147
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,440
here surrounded totally by the ones.

148
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,770
If the island is surrounded completely by ones, then it must be a closed island.

149
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,940
So let's see here.

150
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,090
So here is an example.

151
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,080
This is one island here.

152
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,310
This is one.

153
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,450
Yes, island here.

154
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,780
Now literally the condition is it completely surrounded?

155
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,330
Was once the answer is yes.

156
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:44,670
So as you see here and here and here, all of this from the external world is is once and internally

157
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,720
also ones.

158
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,980
So just round it from everywhere, internally and externally with once.

159
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,170
Another scenario is zero, which is surrounded by ones from all of the directions.

160
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,940
Now.

161
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:09,180
For this zero, it will not be considered y because it isn't surrounded from here and from here by ones,

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,130
the zeros are surrounded from here by by ones.

163
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,210
OK, so this is merely what defines what is surrounded, what it has to be covered from way.

164
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,930
It cannot be a boundary of the of the of the close.

165
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,370
The eye of the island is touching the grid boundaries.

166
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,760
It cannot be island and so on.

167
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,010
Uh, yeah.

168
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,890
This is one more example.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,340
This is exactly this one has further direction here, so it's OK.

170
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,250
This ones are touching the grid, so they are in the boundary anyway.

171
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,650
OK.

172
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,450
The less the problem, we would like to detect the cycads.

173
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:05,230
So we are in a matrix symptoms and and uh, we would like to know if there is a cycle or not here.

174
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,050
So what makes a connected?

175
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,280
What makes a cycle?

176
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,090
The cycle must be of length of four or more.

177
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:23,590
The first of all, and you must the start and end at the same cells and you can move in the normal for

178
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,090
direction up, though in a lift.

179
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,890
But they must match of the same value.

180
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,770
So this is very close to what built the connected components in Philadelphia lecture.

181
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,140
So same values in four directions.

182
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,850
But this time we would like a cycle.

183
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,840
You cannot move back to the cell that you use it and consider it the cycle.

184
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,110
Like, for example, someone at one one go to one two, then one one is, uh, is invalid.

185
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
Uh, yeah.

186
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,570
Let me read that to make sure you cannot move to the side that you visited in your last move.

187
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,950
For example, one one one two one one is invalid because for one two, we visited one one, which would

188
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,970
allow us to visit the cells.

189
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,620
I honestly confused.

190
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,950
Uh, let me tell you what I remember here.

191
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,780
Uh, let's say you are your eight year.

192
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,330
OK.

193
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,940
Let's say you are.

194
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,470
Looks like very ugly.

195
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,750
Let's say you are right here.

196
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,820
So here is the best one, so you can go this way, this way, this way and this way.

197
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,550
So this way you made one second.

198
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,700
As you see the lenses for this is the minimal possible second.

199
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,450
OK, so no one can do something like starting from here, go to here, then go back to here.

200
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,250
This isn't a cycle.

201
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:56,250
As you see, the lens will be just the three and also you just return it back to your previous cell.

202
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,730
It shouldn't be this way.

203
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,850
OK, let's see the examples here, which will make things more clear here, this one.

204
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,650
If we started from here we go.

205
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,460
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

206
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,390
We made a cycle.

207
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,070
So this is one way to make a cycle.

208
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,630
Another one, which is the minimal possible cycle you go from here, here, here and here.

209
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,440
Yeah, that's it.

210
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,960
So this is now there are two possible, so I can see it.

211
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,530
Uh, another case will be here.

212
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:31,190
Uh, I have the impression that I just, uh, I missed an exam, but sorry for that.

213
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,150
This one should be example to hit his example.

214
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,180
Number three.

215
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,550
If you started at this big here, go here.

216
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,010
You cannot go back to this B and this one also.

217
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,490
So overall, there is no there is no psych in here.

218
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,610
So, yeah, just keep in mind the two things that I told you.

219
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,520
It is as normal as the reachability problem.

220
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,110
You go to your four boundaries.

221
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,640
This what create a connected component?

222
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,200
We would like to make sure we are in a cycle.

223
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,230
The lanes must be at least four.

224
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,590
You cannot go back to your your previous cell.

225
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,620
You cannot go back to your lost, Twisted said.

226
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,790
You have to go to a new set.

227
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:07,940
So.

228
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,460
So the matrix four times four would be the.

229
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,420
The best one that you can.

230
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,470
The smallest, ever cycle.

231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,580
Uh, yeah, this is mainly how can you?

232
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,040
This is really the locus of the problem.

233
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,380
This is a statement that, I mean, I believe you say just.

234
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,320
Uh.

235
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,020
Oh, yeah, I got it now.

236
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,590
Sorry for that.

237
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,500
So let's say one based indexing you are at one one, which you say here, and this is one one two,

238
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,760
which is here.

239
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,390
Then you go here, you cannot go back here, which is which is what I was saying.

240
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:52,820
That's all.
