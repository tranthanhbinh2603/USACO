1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,480
Problem number three, and we would like to find the closed islands.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,120
Now in this problem, what will really make our life easier is assemble observation.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,400
What really makes a connected component to closed?

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,290
Simply, it doesn't touch any boundary at all.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,440
So we have here agreed here.

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,850
Now, let's say there is some connected component here.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,840
It is definitely, definitely across the connected component.

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,650
Why?

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,590
Because it would be surrounding from here and from any internet, if any case, with other, with other

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,030
ones, with other values.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,040
This is the definition of a connected component.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,860
There is nothing else that can connect to it.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,270
Now, if there is a connected component is here, this is definitely Boundary Y because it is has it

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,200
is enclosed because it is touching the extent of that of the boundary.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,940
So it's actually in this problem.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,700
If you understood the problem statement really well before just the jumping to solve it, you recognize

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,600
that if my connected component is touching this great boundary here or this grid boundary here or this

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,360
grid boundary here or this grid boundary here, it cannot be a closed island.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,270
Otherwise, it's just a closed island.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,530
So that symbol?

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,560
So the message here is sometimes you need to make some thinking, some analysis.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,520
Don't rush with the first idea in your mind.

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,340
I know that you might eventually managed to get it accepted, but maybe you wrote a lot of unnecessary

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,700
goods.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,220
Maybe you observe yourself in a wrong direction.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,830
So this is a point here.

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,320
Think a little bit deeper now for educational purposes.

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:54,510
I'm going to instead of the building the the the Vista array as a Boolean, I'm replacing it with something

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,810
else.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm going to replace it with the connected component, i.e. no.

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,200
For example, let's say that this is a first connected component to meet.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
I would give it what is one one one one one one.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,500
This is the second communiqu convert that would make it two two to two.

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,150
This is the third connector, what, three three three three.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,910
This is very useful in some other problems where we would like to know what are the exact indices of

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,470
a connected component or anything.

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,140
So this is another way if you if you need the exact values of the connected component, you can use

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,620
the values.

39
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,170
Otherwise we can use a Boolean for one.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,230
So to see the could here, the goods are going to be very straightforward.

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:38,070
I have here a Boolean variable that say during building there, during building that connected component.

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,540
Have we ever touched one of the four boundaries the top left, top row?

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,750
Last call us through the first two column.

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,770
Not any of them.

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,530
If yes, then this isn't and is a closed island.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,780
And here the implementation would be very straightforward, like any normal connected component.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,550
We trade on the rows and columns and then, uh, CCI ID is the connector converter ID instead of the

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,230
Vista Ray.

49
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,230
So see here the connector computers.

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,040
You market them starting from one so that you can differentiate if it's listed or not.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,330
So I would always from what you see here, the connected component is zero.

52
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,320
I will.

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,750
What I would like to make a device, I would make B+ Plus.

54
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,830
This is very important to avoid bugs, and it's not always connected computers from one.

55
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,030
So now the collector convert, it is zero then it never touched before, and in the same time, the

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,520
value should be zero.

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,290
They say that the zeros would represent their goods.

58
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,250
So what I said to the touch boundary was false to the defense increment if it never touched the boundary.

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,390
The difference now is very straightforward.

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,460
This is the normal part.

61
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,210
This is a normal.

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm guessing here the current convert is.

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,210
So every time we visit the route, we give it the same idea.

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,860
Previously, we just put it one here.

65
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,880
Now, the only change is if we have ever at any point of time, Touch ID, one of the four boundaries

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,520
we just the market that is touch boundary is true.

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,500
And how is this function implemented?

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,200
Somebody, you have the row and column, you just need to check if you are the first through or through

69
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,910
the first column or the rascal, if any of that is false, then.

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,920
And if that's true, then we actually touched the boundary.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,780
Otherwise we are on the syllabus.

72
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:27,500
So as you see, the problem is straightforward when you think in it based on this observation, otherwise

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,820
you might actually complicate the code.

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,720
As you see, this is the third.

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,420
The problem we are managed.

76
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,780
I managed to solve it with the standard defense as it is.

77
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,340
I haven't to change, like bring a new theory or any advanced thing so far.

78
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,250
OK, let's see the fourth problem which is detecting their cycle.

79
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,880
I added the second example here, so we would like to detect this like and now this might be might seems

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,950
for a while tricky, but I will show you that it isn't.

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
Now let's remember, why do we need Vistara?

82
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:13,070
I'm here at this node, and I let's maybe this is a better example, this one, this one.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,610
None of them is good enough.

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,530
Let me let me build my own grades.

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,810
Let's say we have a grade here.

86
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,410
Let's pretend you have your ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay.

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
Let's say you started here.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,460
Why do we need the victory?

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,380
There are two cases.

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,180
Why do we need the victory?

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,800
The first one is well when we move to the next node.

92
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,110
Let's go and market this one here, market this one here, a market, this one here.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,060
I'm lucky this one here.

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,410
This one here might go up to try this one here, but we visited it already.

95
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,880
So one reason to avoid their cycles is to use this array here so that I don't go to a node that is visited

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,270
or ready.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,100
The other case, which is successful here, you moved from this one to this one.

98
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,620
This one will try to go back to this one.

99
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,920
So this one is like its appearance and it came to me.

100
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,500
Now we should also go back to that.

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,580
To the beer and to note.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,760
So if you thought about it, this is why we use the mystery to avoid the infinite cycles, which come

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,460
for two reasons you are there trying to go back to your parent, the one that called you or you are

104
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,570
visiting and know that you visited before now thinking about the cycles.

105
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:43,210
The reason that we have a site is we are revisiting a route that we visited before.

106
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,140
So I moved from here to here to here to here to here.

107
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,550
Wait.

108
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,670
We visited this one before, so we would like actually to say, you know what, if you visited the node

109
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,530
that you visited before, this is like?

110
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,070
But there is a problem here now.

111
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:08,710
If I if am trying to visit my beer and let's say we have only here we have this food is OK, which is

112
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,800
the minimum length of the cycle.

113
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,590
So we go from here to here to here.

114
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,220
If this one is trying to go back here, it would say it is visited.

115
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,080
But wait, it is in a cycle.

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,550
This is your appearance.

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,260
So this is the node that generated you.

118
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,160
So this isn't a cycle.

119
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,550
So now it the trick.

120
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:39,240
We will we need the vista, Ray, to tell us if this node is visited before or not, but we need to

121
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,060
be careful about going back to where you came from.

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:50,980
So if we managed to split these two cases, we would be able to use the Vista Array as air signal if

123
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,920
we are a cycle or not.

124
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,700
Let me show you the implementation.

125
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
This might be a bit hard.

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,020
The idea is this following this is our defense.

127
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,970
We will use a very normal device.

128
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,860
We will have two extra indices for one column, which is the bit through and bittencourt it means which

129
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,800
Birand, which rows and column I am coming from them.

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,900
And never, ever try to go back to your parents, if you did that, then the visited array would be

131
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,080
visited only in one case if you are making a cycle.

132
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,580
So here's what happened.

133
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,130
This is very normal.

134
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,710
Vistara, this is a very normal defence.

135
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,000
We have the row and column.

136
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,910
We have the grid.

137
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,040
We have the brilliant array.

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,760
We have the color.

139
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,670
If it is inverted, you go back.

140
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,330
If it doesn't match the color, you go back.

141
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,840
Leave this one for now here.

142
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,160
Now we mark visited with urgency, as usual, we get the the election as usual.

143
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,580
Now this is only one condition Europe adding Here I'm say, let's say I am in this thread, which is

144
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,300
RNC.

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,220
And a zombie to this one, which is new or new, see here, but I know that my variant is this and see

146
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,730
if this one is trying to go back to the Birand.

147
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,850
Don't do that.

148
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,510
So actually, we will go only to three choices, not four.

149
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,490
So if I'm here.

150
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,210
If I was here and jump to hear this one would have only three choices go up.

151
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,340
Go ride, go down.

152
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,800
But it would not go to the beer and it would not go.

153
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,140
Go to the one that generated me.

154
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,210
Now, if this is a case.

155
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:39,120
Then the vista right here will be true if and only if we come back to a quote that we visited before,

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
and this would happen only and cycle of for already.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,670
So we do need to verify anything about the rest of the second.

158
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,290
So let's see an example here.

159
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,120
Let's say we have a a a a a a and there is a B in the middle.

160
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,500
This one?

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Go here.

162
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,690
This one cannot go to work to the bitter end, but can go here, which you can go here.

163
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,170
This one cannot go back here.

164
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,990
This one can go here, can go here.

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,610
Cannot go back and go here.

166
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,130
Can go here, can go here vested.

167
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,720
This means a cycle.

168
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,140
I hope you now got it.

169
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,370
This dirty trick is very common and very important and and you should see it in many times, it seems

170
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,690
like after the good, don't fix it.

171
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,720
So the moral of that is that this thing is happening from two things.

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,020
It happened from coming about going back to my beer, the one who generated me or actually visiting

173
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,220
something new, different.

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,420
Now in this good, the new trick is we split the two cases.

175
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,010
So this is case number one.

176
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,870
We prevent it here fundamentally from the beginning, and this is case number two at any point of time

177
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,220
who vested in this condition.

178
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,290
We definitely have a second.
