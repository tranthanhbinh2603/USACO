1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,790
Let's proceed solving the problem.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,020
First of all, I have here a similar external utility.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,530
They try to take some position, RNC Animatrix and just tell me if this is a position within the utility

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,960
within the metrics are not so we have here to the metrics.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,230
And I would like to know if this is a valid position or not.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,500
So something that's here, something that's here, they are invited one.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,710
So I verify the rules are valid.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,890
The columns are valid.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,420
If none is valid, return defaults.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,980
Otherwise, returning to this is a requested function that we have to do it.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,890
I started by creating a visited matrix.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,350
Now remember, in the normal defense, we would like to make sure the node is visited or not.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,860
So when we have any nodes, we created vector of any nodes.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,780
Now we have a matrix of 2D.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,920
So I created a 2D matrix of rows and columns that represent that the given Imbert and Sebastian one.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,220
So the first the change here we use the Boolean matrix.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,640
But to do this time, we started by calling the defense function, giving it the source and destination

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,220
and giving it the all the color.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,200
And here is the new color to market.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,550
Now let's see.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,900
How can we do the defense?

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,310
We started as following, we've we've verified if The Matrix, OK, we started with sub RNC would like

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,250
to know out of this RNC invalid if yes, return is a cell visited before during the defense, if yes,

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:32,090
certain if the all the color we have doesn't match the current fiscal position.

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,860
Also, skip it.

26
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,820
So these are the different cases where we skip the values.

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,860
Otherwise RNC now would represent my Newt indices.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,460
So a more currency was through here and I replaced the old the color with the new colors.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,540
I hope you can see that the like the the correspondence between the Normandy office now we have four

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,860
neighbors, one of them at plus one and zero minus one and zero zero a minus one zero and the plus one.

31
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,090
And again, ambassador, all the color that we have in the new column have.

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:15,620
I hope you can see that we are dealing with each other in the sea as our roots.

33
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,900
When I tell you what are the ages of us we have went into from here, when, from here, when, from

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,730
here and from here, so we can build the four edges, see it in a different way, in a very similar

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,030
way.

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,510
And as this recursive function is making for calls, we are validating here the are within the boundary.

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,090
We are validating that we never visited this before.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,220
We are validating that we have the same color.

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,530
If any of that is wrong, we return.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,090
Otherwise market the cell node, iterate on the four edges.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,820
I hope you can see the correctness of the good.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,220
Now let's make things more elegant.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,060
Don't proceed in the video if you don't 100 percent to get this good.

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,460
Now what if you have it Niebuhr's, you will write it lines of code.

45
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,950
What if you have 24 Niebuhr's?

46
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,860
You write 24 lines of code.

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,910
This is very, uh, stupid a slide.

48
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,730
We need a way to make it more elegant.

49
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,410
So how can we make that?

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,670
That's the question.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,730
Think for 30 minutes about this.

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,110
This question?
