1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,050
Let's solve the problem, number three, this is actually the heart of the problem here, like the this

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,550
problem is in an easy one, even for an experienced programmer who might get lost to here.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,310
I will provide you with a single hint that will make this problem from the heart of the problem to an

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,030
easy problem.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,310
The hint is to use binary search.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,300
Remember?

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,610
That it could six, six, eight problem, the one about the multiplication when we have the multiplication

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,380
of in in values is very similar by necessity.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,170
So how can you make use of this hint?

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,880
OK.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,130
Here is the key.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:44,830
Assume we have function that takes of the heights matrix and limit it returns through if and only if

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,350
the maximum possible absolute difference of some bears is less than or equal the limit.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,370
And remember that inequality?

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,940
We mentioned that in the in decision.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,130
The equality of inequality can help us to create a multi-ethnic space.

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,440
If I say equal the limit, it would be like a zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,250
If I said Lizelle Equal, it would be like zero zero zero one one one one one, which is monotonic.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,550
Now again, I would give you the heights and a limit.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm asking you, can we find a Abarth such that the maximum possible difference is less than or equal

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,280
the limit?

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,080
Now think about it.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,040
Assume that for, for example, limit number 10.

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,680
The answer is true, then definitely.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,970
Those are true for limited living.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,320
Like, if I can think of us was value seven, which is this an equal 10, then also equal 11 also deserve

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,190
equal 12.

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,250
That's why the social space like are zero zero zero one one one one.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,500
OK, what is the.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,880
I'm asking you for limits?

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
17.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,660
Sorry if the minimum is 17.

33
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,010
So 10 doesn't work.

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,480
It even then.

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,470
Nine doesn't work.

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,490
It doesn't work.

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,720
So going backward will feel going forward will succeed.

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,900
This is clearly a monotonically increasing function.

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,990
So the first observation here, the possible function in this problem is a one trick function.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,500
Now let's do a binary search.

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,050
Such that we would like to find the first limit that is possible, so let's say this limited add value

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,210
eat, so we actually return to eat.

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,050
OK, it is like a first occurrence, as we did a lot to like that before.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,340
So the the homework here, we first decoded it using the binary search in a very similar way to the

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,650
case number three in the binary.

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,700
Such a case, as we mentioned before, the heart of the case where you are using something like that

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,740
to find a reasonable function.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,540
And now using the limit, we would like to find the answer.

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,570
I hope you got the the algorithm so far.

50
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,270
Binary search on the limit find the first limit that the possible function is returning through.

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,520
No, the remaining question, which is easy.

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,130
How can we implement the possible function?

53
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,900
We have a matrix here.

54
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,110
I started from here.

55
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,070
I would like to go from here, but my limit is seven, for example.

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,830
So that's the idea is very easy to do.

57
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,210
Afloat fell and this graph.

58
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,070
And you cannot go to any vote if and only if it needs a more than seven that symbol.

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,970
Again, do edifice reachability office.

60
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,980
Remember the day on the grid?

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,500
You can go to the four directions.

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,560
Previously in the flat world, you go to the neighbor if it has the same color.

63
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,770
Now I can go to the neighbor if the difference between me and him, the absolute difference is less

64
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,000
than or equal.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,220
Seven If this is the case, we can just proceed.

66
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,140
And in this way, we are done.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,570
Now why this problem is a bit hard for an experienced programmer because there can be a lot of ideas

68
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,680
that can come to his mind.

69
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,330
Maybe the right programming problem?

70
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,670
Maybe backtracking.

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,780
Maybe Minkus smacks of law, maybe binary search.

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,380
So as someone who has a lot of tools, this problem can be confusing.

73
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,810
I give you this problem now where what what we have so far in the courts, we learned the sorting,

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,420
we learned the searching way in research.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,340
We learned the defense, right?

76
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,550
So clearly, your toolbox is just consist of these three items, and we actually needed this to here.

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
If I give you the same problem.

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,970
After the end of what to do with, you know, all of these algorithms, all of these directions might

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,390
be bad.

80
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,880
So sometimes when you have more and more tools, while it is very advantage, but also it's a bigger

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,570
challenge here.

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,670
Anyway, let's see them alimentacion.

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,940
Um, here is the brain research I started with the minimum.

84
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,280
Zero, the maximum is just that the max, the value in the problem statement that we do normal brain

85
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,860
research.

86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,940
And if it is possible, then we assign the result to the med and move to the lower body so that we can

87
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,810
mix them.

88
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm mixing that less than an equal condition here, as we did many times before.

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,330
Now the possible function is as following the possible function is creating visited array on the size

90
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,440
of the matrix and starting from zero and zero, giving the heights array, giving the vista ray and

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
there the limit.

92
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:29,710
Now going to the function itself, this is as we did before, the directions of the AFC and um oh,

93
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,780
I made this function to be bullion so that it can directly stop once we found the field.

94
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,850
So here is a function.

95
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:43,240
It started from raw and see if we manage at any time to reach the end of their grid like we started

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,170
from zero to zero.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,800
If at any point of time the DFS is here, then we are done now.

98
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,470
Otherwise, as usual, we market their sit as vested.

99
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,790
We trade on the news.

100
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,770
Now here it is our condition.

101
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,240
If it is invalid, sell cancel it if it is visited before cancel it.

102
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,860
If the difference between me and my neighbor is greater than the limit, cancel it.

103
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,370
Otherwise, we DFS on the neighbor observer.

104
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,460
This if condition, I say if true, which means that this direction managed to reach the said we can

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
return true.

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,750
I can implement that was the bullion.

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,990
We did many times before we defined here a variable we can say we can define here a boolean and say

108
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,700
is rigid and we run the defense the normal way a market is, Richard withdrew.

109
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,940
But this is a different way, another way to cool things.

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,210
The function itself is containing the Boolean variable.

111
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,210
This condition here is important condition.

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I hope the idea is manageable for you.

113
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,750
It is in that nightmare.

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,490
You can still get its components.
