1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's solve a number three, the number three is the connected component, the problem.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,180
This is a very fundamental problem.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,100
You should understand it very well because you will meet it several times during the graph theory.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,200
So let's see.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,910
The good is actually overall is a minor modification from the reachability.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,160
Could we know in the reachability?

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,030
The moral of it was to find the roots that are ritual for you.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,870
So, for example, if we have year node one to.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,400
Three.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,320
Four and then five here, so starting from one, we go from one to two market to market three market

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
for market, we cannot go to five because the directed graph.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,430
Now, when it comes to the connected components, it isn't about directed graph sexually, about the

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,610
undirected graph.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,410
So we have here a component component and we have here another component.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,850
So now how can we know?

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,860
They'll know that these are two components.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,030
We will use the same device?

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,600
Exactly.

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,770
They did this following you started from another doesn't belong to a component.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,430
Then you do a device from this note to Carl to mark all of their reachable nodes are from it, according

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,420
to undirected graph.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,400
Once you're done, let's say this is not number one.

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,240
This is two.

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,950
This is war and this is five.

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,320
This is three, six and seven.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Now you started from one, which was unmarked and then you saw a lot of it.

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,260
After the end of the first third, one two with four or five are all market assisted nodes.

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,990
Now you moved in with number two revisited?

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,330
Yes.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,290
Move node number three, I revisited no.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,360
This being that node number three is in reachable from any previous component.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,340
So we have a new component here.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,640
So again, the device, which will mark three and seven and six, then we check in with number four

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,400
market five Market six Market seven market.

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,960
So that's old.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,610
There's no more magic than that.

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,700
So it's a minor modification to the reachability.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,630
Good to do that.

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,440
Feel free to stop the video at this point and to try to implement the good by yourself in the future.

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,230
This problem can be done in many other ways, like the Beerfest or the Union find or what we call digital

41
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,680
assets.

42
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,680
So let's see now the implementation itself.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,530
Adding Building, directing graph, all of that is the same, even the defense is a theme.

44
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,890
Now the only change here is a function for connected component.

45
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,950
The first thing to notice is the twisted array.

46
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,470
It will be defined here as a shared among all of them.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Remember when we could the rich ability to bring to the reachable note from every node we were iterating

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,060
and iteration in each iteration, we create a new Boolean array.

49
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:56,440
Now we would like during the after the first to know which nodes are reachable so far.

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,880
So you need to make something that is shared and then iterate.

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,880
And if I found and would not vested, then this node doesn't belong to any serious connected component.

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,880
So we know we have one more connected component here than we did first, starting from this connected

53
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,420
component.

54
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,350
So in the first connected component, for example, this chain would be market in the second component.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,100
Maybe this one would be marketed and the third component.

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,410
Maybe this one will be marketed and so on.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,170
In every one of them, there will be at least one node that was never reachable from all of the other

58
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,500
nodes.

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,950
So someone may claim, OK, what if this node isn't reachable?

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,120
But this is reachable impossible because of this is reachable using the device or on directed graph,

61
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,390
it will cover everything.

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,760
So this is an informal group that whenever we find a node that is invested so far, it mostly means

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,360
that this is a component that no one ever recorded before.

64
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,110
So as you see, overall, the Defense Code, the building graph, all of the same and minor changes

65
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,270
to the reachability function.

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,550
Now what does the time complexity of that?

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,670
The same time complexity and the same memory complexity?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,540
Why?

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,450
Because in the connected component case, you will just reach once upset that another subset than a

70
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,740
third of the subset and so on.

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,660
So eventually, governing all of the edges of the graph and covering all of the rules of the graph.

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,690
So this is merely that reachability problem.
