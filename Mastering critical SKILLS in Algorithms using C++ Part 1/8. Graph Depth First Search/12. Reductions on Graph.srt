1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,840
I would like here to share with you something a bit advanced.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,000
I would like you to know about it, which is the reductions to graphs.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,860
What does it mean?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,560
Would the reduction has a lot of meanings.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,380
Sometimes when you read the problem, let's say I'm telling you you have a matrix and this matrix has

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,750
a cell here and there is a treasure in and out of the cell and would like, you know, if the if the

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,740
man can find the treasure or not, you can see that this is a matrix.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,670
Every node is there.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,490
Actually, every every word is actually a node.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,250
You can know that because matrices are anyway graphs.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,800
Sometimes you read the problem and there is zero connection with graph theory, and you don't even think

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,260
that this has a relationship with graffiti at all.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,360
And with some smart observations, you can model it as a graph.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,860
Why this category of problems is very hard because you don't see the graph, you don't have a graph

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,430
problem.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,720
It is invisible at all.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,440
So what happened is you don't consider graphs.

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,310
However, it is possible using graphs.

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,440
Let me give you a great example here.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,140
Let's say I give you a bunch of fractions here, like maybe fraction number one, equal a over B symbols

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,770
and the values is that say, here are four B, let's say was value number three, for example, fraction

22
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,130
two.

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,140
It is symbols B oversea and let's see the value is half production.

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,560
Three.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,090
Let's say symbol C over the and the value is four.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,360
And I.

27
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,640
First of all, do you see any connection with graphs?

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,100
Can you spot anything?

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,760
OK.

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:57,840
Let me ask you the task, because that is what is the fraction value of E250 know mathematically, Eovaldi

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:08,380
can be committed from, um, from if one finds, if at all times everything we can do that by our mind,

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,570
this is the which will be eventually like a over b times, b over c times c over the.

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,430
It over the which is eventually three times before 12 would half is six value.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,420
Let me ask you again, do you see any connections with graphs?

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,130
What what if I asked you for the value of be over, for example, or anything like that?

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,060
You have to make a lot of resolving, right?

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,980
Can you see a relationship of the graph?

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,650
OK.

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,670
It is a relationship.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,990
If you thought that every symbol is A..

41
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,900
So we have here A. A.

42
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,990
It would be no see, no deal, and the production value represent an inch.

43
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,250
So we have an idea from A to B with the value of three and have an edge from B to E with the value of

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,300
one over three.

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,960
And we have an edge from B to C would have.

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,700
And we have an edge from sea to B was one Oberhof, which is two.

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:29,450
And we have an edge of from Setoodeh with um c 2D with wood and from D to C with one over four, which

48
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,620
is zero point two five.

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,680
Now, this is a graph.

50
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,880
OK?

51
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,420
What is the fraction value from A to Z?

52
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,980
It equals the multiplication of the ages from eight to D so far and now the multiplication of HD, which

53
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,180
is that here is an inch.

54
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,320
It is an edge.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,400
There is an edge.

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,580
The answer is three times half times four.

57
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,230
What about that?

58
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,340
The answer from what is the value of C over eight, for example, is again, it is a best two.

59
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,780
And here is the best two.

60
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,330
So we can see that the answer of C over eight is just two over three.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,210
Now you see, we can even with fractions in a very nice and easy way with just finding a better multiplying

62
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,990
its values.

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,850
So the key here is it's very hard to see that this problem is a graft problem.

64
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,560
Very, very hard, the problem.

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,700
But you see someone can spot that this is an edge and this is an engine, this is an edge.

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,340
Let me give you another problem.

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,630
This is a geometric problem.

68
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,130
Can you model it as a graph like assume that I'm asking you for the for the maybe, maybe this distance

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,670
or anything?

70
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,900
I will not go into details here.

71
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,740
What is the graph?

72
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,840
If you started to think about the intersection points here, like this point here, this one here,

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,680
this one here, this one here, maybe also this one here, this one here, you can think of this intersection,

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,190
but this may be as a graph and connections between them as it just that has some distance.

75
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,930
I know the folly of imagination and treatment of the problem isn't clear because I don't give details,

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,340
but I wanted to tell you.

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,070
You see how very far from graph theory, but you can spot some graph relationship.

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,610
It needs a lot of smartness and a lot of creativity so that you can figure out where are the graphs.

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,440
So there are no rules for that.

80
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,610
I cannot write for you some rules or even better for that.

81
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,920
This is one of the hardest types of problems.

82
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,250
And even practically speaking, there are a few problems that will have this this idea.

83
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,120
It happens a lot that we can like.

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Maybe.

85
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,270
Generally speaking, we have some problem and we see that this problem can be represented as a graph

86
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,700
or maybe have a problem and see that this problem maybe can represent it as a geometry problems.

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,600
Uh, yeah, this kind of reduction is one of the hardest skills ever, and it takes a lot of time and

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,430
experience to develop them.

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,450
Solve.
