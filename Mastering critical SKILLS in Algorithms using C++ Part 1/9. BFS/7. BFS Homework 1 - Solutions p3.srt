1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,640
What are the problem number three?

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:08,800
It's actually a very straightforward application for the beef's, but this time on there, uh, well,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,150
with the undergrad, that's it.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,080
Nothing more than that.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,100
So this is our normal array.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,860
This is our validation function.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,980
We can comparison of that in a single line of goods.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,170
And here is our business.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:29,060
So I started by the following a couple of iterations here that will tell me where is the starting point?

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,400
So we keep searching until we find the first to start.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,740
Then we put the here you can try to brick and break because anyway, there's research here, then with

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,130
daily BFS to start from this starting point.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
Once we are done with that, we start to do our asset.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,100
So we have a victory, which is to the metrics as usual.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,830
And I have a queue of sell to make it easy for myself.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,300
I can make it kill, bear or so, but just it's more lovely this way here.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,730
Uh, you start, you add the queue, start to the queue and then you market position was through our

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,710
very classical port here.

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,840
And then we get the four neighbors.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,750
If it has a hash, then we return at level plus one, which is the shortest to bath at the moment.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,250
So this is the first the hash we have.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,220
Otherwise, we added again and just keep going.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,900
So as you see, we don't have anything more than what we needed.

24
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:30,880
So that's all I want to say to you that maybe some people will just not use visited array and use the

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,180
matrix itself to market by setting an X in the matrix.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,310
So you might, if you want, you can ignore or you can ignore, ignore having this one and just keep

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,770
changing.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,900
The metrics itself was X, because in a way we don't we don't go to, I said with an X value.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,660
This is good for competition.

30
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,900
This is good for fun.

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,750
But actually in industry, we didn't do that in interviews and do that.

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,580
Sometimes I actually tried to use their centre parameters.

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,290
But just remember, this is like maybe create a shorter code, faster code, but in industry wouldn't

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:02,650
do that.

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,230
And one reason for that is sometimes our function are paralyzed.

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,490
So there are more than a thread that is using this the same object, and no one is expecting you to

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,560
change the object that is given to you.

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,300
Anyway, that's all.
