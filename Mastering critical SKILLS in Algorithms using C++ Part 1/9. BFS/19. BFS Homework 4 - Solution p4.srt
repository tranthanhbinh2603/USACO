1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,100
And that is the problem, this might be a bit puzzling for you, but one major source of puzzling is

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,560
actually not tracing and understanding the problem.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,400
The second reason it doesn't look like darkly like a graph problem or a water like a b, a face a problem.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,120
So the moral of this problem, this is what we call a simulation problem.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,570
There is a process you simulated.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,240
That's it.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,790
So the problem is actually telling you, keep opening the boxes, keep taking elements from the boxes

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,920
up in the boxes to keys, open the boxes and so on as long as you can do nothing anymore.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,580
So that's all in the in the in the problem.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:45,820
So now when you think about it, if a box is inwards and the boxes inside and the boxes inside it building

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,200
the edges, then this is a graph.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
So that's all.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,190
Now when you think about it.

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,510
Well, what we need is to traverse this graph, but observe here the order doesn't matter.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,620
This is one thing.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,100
Also, it looks like the global status like the order doesn't matter, and the more you open things

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,560
as if the more keys you got.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,600
So this is a very like and a standard here.

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,800
This is what makes the problem a bit hard.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,960
So now you have a global status of what are the keys that they have, which are boxes are opened.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,420
What are the number of candies collected so far?

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,010
This is like your global status.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,510
And you keep updating it.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,720
So, um, what we need is to just simulated, can we?

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,460
And given that this is a graph, remember this is a graph and the graph needs someone to simulate to

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,150
traverse it.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,330
So one can think, OK, I'm going to use the first or b first to do that.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,900
So B, if this was multi source, is going to be an excellent choice here.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,930
The total number of states are just put in here.

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,560
OK, let's see the implementation.

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,930
So what do you have in the queue?

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:57,800
The queue has a queue of integers, queue of integers and we push in each itchycoo the box ID and we

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,060
have in the boxes at most.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,140
We have here a vector of Boolean to say just visited or not.

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:16,560
So it's like, yeah, based mainly on the the size of the number of boxes I have here to helpful utilities.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,290
The code is very ad hoc.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,560
One of them that add the keys from the boxes and I want another one to open the boxes.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,280
So I do that here for the initial boxes that they give it to me.

39
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,810
So I have initiated a status.

40
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,480
This will create the multi source that I have.

41
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,760
The remaining of the code is a straight forward.

42
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,290
You get the box, you Bobbit, then you add, you add the keys from it.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
You open the more boxes that you can open it right now.

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,030
OK, at guys is just iterating on every box, getting the keys from this book's marking the key as one.

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,270
Remember, these are our global status.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,600
OK, now the open boxes of the following We have a box and this box has.

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,610
And we have we have some, some new keys and all the keys, but the Vista array can tell us if this

48
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,570
is open or not.

49
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,950
So if any key is new for us now and never visited, we would push these books and market as listed and

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,510
take the Kennedys inside it.

51
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,700
This good would be okay, too good if the problem itself is in your mind.

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,660
If you don't have all of these elements together, you will get lost.

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,880
Um, I hope it isn't that hard to like to like to understand.
