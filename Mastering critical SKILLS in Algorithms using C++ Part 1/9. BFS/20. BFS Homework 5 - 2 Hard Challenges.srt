1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,040
And there was a problem, a bit of challenging problems.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,760
And the first one, the shots, the bridge problem as a swallowing.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:20,760
You will have a matrix binary values which represent exactly two islands and the island is connected

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,740
in the four possible directions.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:34,140
So when you have here a cell as usual, right down underfoot now, we would like to connect the two

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,910
grids together.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,660
So you would like to take the minimum number of zeros, convert them to one so that they are connected.

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,660
So for example, here when you see the first one, if you converted this one to one, now the two grids

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,400
are connected here.

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,070
If you market this one as one and this one has one.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,950
Now we are connected and this one, if you connected this one from here, it's now connected.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,360
This is exactly the problem.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,720
Now you can brute force this problem, but I would like you to challenge yourself and implement it in

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,010
all rules time columns.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,090
The next the problem.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,660
That extra problem is very popular computer science a problem, it's good, the three diameter.

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,900
The problem exists the only good, but it is premium discrete bulimia.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,950
So if you don't have an account, you will not be able to obtain it.

19
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,420
I am going to use the virgin coming from sponge or mine judge.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,100
So the problem is is following you will have unweighted, undirected, valid three.

21
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,220
You would like to return it the length of the longest to bath in the three, which is the length of

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,200
the longest between two nodes here.

23
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,210
Now in in in in graph theory, we called the longest to bath in a tree.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,340
We call it the diameter.

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,110
So we call it the three day method.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,160
So this is a description of liquid you will start to by reading one integer.

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,560
Each file is just consisting of a single graph.

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,120
You will read the number of nodes, which are three, then read the edges one two to three so that the

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,250
graph for you is like one to two to three, which is just to observe here the end.

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,390
But in the first bush is one be, so you have to convert that to zero based.

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,420
Am also providing you with a similar split symbol.

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,460
It would all you have to implement is just the three diameter function.

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,970
That's it.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,720
Let's see some examples.

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,020
This examples from Whittaker's Likud website, which are just more examples for you here.

36
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,080
This is again two steps now in this one here.

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,350
If you look there, this here, here, here, here.

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,570
This is the longest Sabbath.

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,800
This is a three diameter.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,810
Now it is a point.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,460
We can implement this problem with two different solution, the first one is very, very popular on

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,150
the internet.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,840
The second one is rarely mentioned and is mentioned more than a data structure, a context rather than

44
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,850
this problem context here.

45
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:09,950
Now, the first solution, which is very popular people do it, is using only to be a fiscals.

46
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,770
So you might think, how can you do it with two before schools?

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,810
Or you can think in a slow version, which can do multiple calls to find the answer?

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,370
The proof of this one is an easy one.

49
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,200
Now the interesting thing is, and this is what people most of the people do mention, we can't solve

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,750
this problem with only a single day for school, not just to give one one single.

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,440
I would like to give you a hint try to think in a rooted binary tree.

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,550
You remember the way military it has usually two children only.

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,400
So how can we compute the diameter of around crowded, routed by military?

54
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,390
Think of a symbol be a first, a simple defense that can do it?

55
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,320
Uh, don't waste too much time here thinking forever.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,650
Maybe have an hour or so and then proceed.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,440
Try this one too, and then see my solutions.

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,210
That's all.
