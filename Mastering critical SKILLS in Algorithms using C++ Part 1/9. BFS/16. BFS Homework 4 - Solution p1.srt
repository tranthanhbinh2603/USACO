1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,090
Let's solve the homework of this problems.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,770
So the first one about the shortest path in translating colors the red and blue.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,320
Um, so let's see here.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,880
This probably introduce us to a very important type of graphs.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,090
So in a classical standard, the graph, you can have a graph of symbol nodes zero one, two three and

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,570
so on.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,370
Now this is the graph that is something that I call history the graph in a stick graph.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,050
We also have nodes and we also have edges.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,180
But the node this time is a bit big.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,640
It consists of many different things.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,620
For example, what if you if you're not consist of a string and an integer like a string of three letters,

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:53,430
maybe, for example, Abbasid and a number from zero to nine, for example, here, maybe six, for

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,850
example, and that is somehow connection between the nodes.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,410
So what is a state?

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,140
A state is bunch of elements.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,590
The most classical state is a number from zero two to minus one, the largest.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,250
It can have anything there.

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,590
The node may be representing a vector.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,590
The node may be representing three strings.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,160
The node may represent three strings and a single number.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,690
The node may represent two numbers.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,440
The node represents anything.

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,600
So, as did Graph is a case where the node consisting of many things together.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,480
OK.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,730
I hope you got this idea.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,880
Now the key to this problem is to realize this problem isn't about a graph of any nodes.

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,140
They are actually like to any nodes or specifically.

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:51,380
It is a state graph where each node is an index from zero to the minus one and a Boolean variable zero

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,120
or one or higher red and blue.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,150
If you realize this fact, you would be able to implement this problem in a very straightforward way.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:09,060
So again, this is a steep graph where the node has to integer one integer representing an index of

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,770
from zero to minus one and another value representing is it red or blue?

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
A Boolean flag zero or one?

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:26,030
And that's why, given that the original graph has in the nodes, but like the connection from from

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,190
from another to another depends on the color we used to come to this node.

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,540
So this node isn't just now, but from zero to minus one.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,730
It also has the color that has been used to reach this node.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,970
So while we are building the graph, we're building it like I have here A. Let's say node number seven

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,960
and it has edge to node number five was color red.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
If I.

41
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,900
Let's say also, I have another node like mine was color blue.

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,750
If I Richard Node seven was color, let's see red, then I cannot take this best.

43
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,120
I can only take this bus.

44
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,400
And once I take the nine, I Amaka that I Richard, nine, with blue.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:24,190
So when you think of it, even in terms of Vista Array, the Vista case is again of two things a number

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:31,000
from zero to minus one and a status for Boolean value zero or one.

47
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,530
I hope you get the idea.

48
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,010
If you thought it this way, you now adjusted the whole standard to be a first to work on estates.

49
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,340
What we will do here in terms of coding will be standard and you can use it in all of the problems.

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,380
So the take home lesson is as following what is a solid graph, the second thing is just to generate

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,370
the graph and try to create like an explicit to any nodes the graph you get.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,470
You might think of that, but don't do that.

53
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,330
So now let's see.

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,110
Let's see the implementation of this idea.

55
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,360
First of all, I created an image that this time consist of two and colors.

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,850
What is the note that we will go to it?

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,680
What is the color of this, not the color of the edge that has been used to distort?

58
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:30,170
And here in adding edge from from and to with color with just an edge from was there too and color,

59
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,290
there'd be a face to start as following.

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,340
First of all, the Line three is in terms of two.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,590
And if I was to know that now you can just say I visited Node seven.

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,660
You must say, did you visit seven?

63
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,600
Was red or did you visit seven was blue?

64
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,330
It matters now when you think about that starting point.

65
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,310
What is the starting point here?

66
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,840
We have a starting node.

67
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,200
But wait, what is the color that you used to do the starting node?

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,180
We are now here, just starting, so we can think of this as a multi source.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,770
We have two different cases.

70
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,860
We can start to the node with red or we kind of started.

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,670
The node was blue.

72
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:19,790
We have the freedom to do that and then also do their, uh, their initialization of that in theory.

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,460
So now we can say the answer to the start is zero.

74
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,310
We will keep answering was the best the value we reach.

75
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,830
Now let's go.

76
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,800
This is very normal as we iterate on every edge I have if.

77
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,390
The edgy color different to them might color a year will get the nod and get the color of there over

78
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,900
the nude if the color doesn't match the color.

79
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,280
And also, we didn't reach to their length not before, so it is invested before then we will watch

80
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,210
this new age.

81
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,470
We will mark its eleventh hour observed with the following.

82
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,560
The answer here is about the shortest way to reach wood.

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:07,160
So if we're Richard Node seven from red was value five first, then later.

84
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,340
If we try to reach the Note seven was color black, it must be five us, so we see here.

85
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,930
If the answer to the Note five is minus one, it means the first time to reach it.

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,300
Then just a sign this value, you will never reach it with something better than the current level.

87
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,010
I know that this could be a bit new for you might be chucking a little bit.

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:36,170
But what I would like you here to observe is we were generalizing the BFC could to act on a stick graph.

89
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:44,990
So you need visited array to represent that, um, the streets, you need to decide what are the possible

90
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,890
initiative states.

91
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:52,280
You need to iterate on the graph in a normal way, but is take time to review this vigil and to think

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,850
about it.

93
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,250
Think how can we generalize the graph form?

94
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,340
Just normal bunch of values that are connected together to as the graph?
