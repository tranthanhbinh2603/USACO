1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,180
Phonebook number three.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,690
Um, in this type of homework, we move to another kind of experiences that I would like you to gain

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,260
with the business.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,200
So here is the problem we have.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,580
We have a grid like that and we would like the following.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,970
So we have here, we have three valleys in this grid.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,530
We have minus one for an obstacle.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,790
We have a gate, which is zero and we has a very huge value.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:36,890
Specifically, this big value to fill an empty room and we would like to from from every meeting room

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,200
to know where is the nearest the gate for it or if it's impossible to reach a gate, we just should

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,580
fill it with the infinity.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,130
So we take this to this structure and fill it with their.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:59,720
Either the distance or that this infinity value, so here is the here is the gate and there are there

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,940
are mainly in this one.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,900
There are two two rooms here, two gates hitters get what?

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,080
And he does get the gate two and for every MBT.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,490
So we would like to record their distance to the shortest gate.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,150
For example, I can go from here in three steps to here or one two three four two here.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,040
So this is the shortest one for me.

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,450
For this one, I can go one two three four.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,110
So four steps of four here or one two three four five six seven seven steps for you.

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,300
So the smallest is four.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,340
So you return for every position, the distance to the nearest the gate.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,050
Um, now here are more examples, basic examples.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,360
Um, I would like you to try to process that in an efficient way.

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,210
You might be thinking in a very brute force way.

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,170
I would like you to do something that has a complex you of all rules.

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,790
Time columns.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,530
So try to do something like that.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,300
Let's move.

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:12,290
Um, we have here a matrix and there is a massive coalition, which is mainly can be represented by

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,830
the top above the top rule and the first to call them here.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:24,200
I don't have the Atlantic Ocean, which is after the last, uh, column and after the last true now.

34
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,340
And here is the request.

35
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,320
Yeah, let me try to make sure that I didn't forget it.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,630
It says that it's raining a lot.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,330
And when there is a water, the water can flow to neighbors in the four possible direction that we used

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,510
to them, but it to flow from a cell to another.

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,930
It must be less than or equal to it in the current the height.

40
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,050
So this values here represent some heights.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,800
And if there is water, come to this one here.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,470
The water can float here and float the here.

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,770
Why?

44
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,720
Because they are less than or equal to it.

45
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,930
But for example, if the water at three, the three can float to one, but it cannot float to four,

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,150
it cannot float to five.

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,270
And this is very logical.

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,210
So imagine this everyone is like a height of this cell.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,500
The water can float only to something that is equal value and less value.

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,510
Now what is the request?

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,370
The request is as follows.

52
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:29,410
You will return a list of the positions such that the water can flow from the position to both of the

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,750
oceans can flood to both of the oceans.

54
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:40,450
So let's see here if we are given this input here, this one now we can see that the value five can

55
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,020
float to the massive cushion and also can.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,290
You can float to the Atlantic now for this one.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,120
It also can float to the Atlantic.

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,870
And also it can float to the Pacific.

59
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,910
Now let's see what about the value at five?

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:09,670
The value at five here, it can flood to three, then one, so it can go and get flood to four and two

61
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,420
and go.

62
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:17,170
So as you see, so overall, you would like to return this positions that can flood to both of them.

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,090
So for a cell to float to the Atlantic, it has to reach either this one or this one here.

64
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,790
And for a cell to reach the massive ocean, it has to float here or here in the upper tier here.

65
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,420
So as you see the common between this problem and the previous problem, you have bunch of things like

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,060
it doesn't look like something want to go to something.

67
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,790
It seems like multiple of things would like to go to multiple things.

68
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,650
You know, we had another.

69
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,030
So how can we change our code to again be very efficient?

70
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,740
All those.

71
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,960
Times economies, for example, think about that.

72
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,550
And the third problem, it has some some mix between the idea of the previous two problems and also

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,880
something about the idea from the previous homework.

74
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,560
Uh, OK, so here is a problem.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,540
The problem say a staggering number is an integer such that all its adjacent digits have an absolute

76
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,040
difference of exactly one.

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,170
So let's say we have three to one.

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,580
If you look to it.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,930
This is the being number.

80
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,470
Why we have three and two and one between three and two is one between two and one is one.

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,300
The difference is exactly one four, two and one is in this tipping number because from 42, there are

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,250
two digits more examples.

83
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,820
If I say something like seven after seven, there can be only six or they can be only five because the

84
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,690
difference between them is two steps for the six.

85
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,590
After that can be five or four.

86
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,880
So the either will be seven, six, five or seven, six or four and so on.

87
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,800
The problem is asking for the following you will be given low and integer they are in the earlier in

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,070
the year.

89
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,150
Forget about this long ruling.

90
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,410
Here they are.

91
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,030
Integer law.

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,730
Integrate.

93
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,260
OK?

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:16,950
And you are to return list of numbers that has all of the stabbing numbers between the low and the high

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,140
and but is sorted them observe that the value is up to 10 to the bow nine.

96
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,860
So be careful from overflows.

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,990
So here is an example between zero and twenty one.

98
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,210
This is a list of the numbers between 10, 10 and 15.

99
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,100
That is only these two numbers who are stimming numbers.

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,640
That's all.
