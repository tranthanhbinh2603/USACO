1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,990
Let's see, how can we put him into that?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,230
We start the year by MC and be a first of the rules to make the objects that we need in the query.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,170
We this is a normal breakfast on a grid.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,130
We will iterate on the metrics and any cell that has a value zero.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,870
We know that this is a starting point.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:24,610
So we use here kudos bush and market to market it as a visited and edit it as a starting point.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,220
The second, the change, which is very important.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,980
You should right size equal Q to size.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,900
Maybe you can, even from that one, make it a habit like you always right size equal Q that size.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,750
So if the Q has a single note, it's OK.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
If the Q has more than not, it will be OK because if you forget this one, the good will not work.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:49,990
But obviously everything else in this problem is exactly the general, uh, the general iteration on

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,600
the in the could not nothing, nothing more fancy here.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,250
So the overall of this problem, we use the reverse the thinking.

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,520
So by reverse thinking, we we notice that the room need one gate.

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,010
But if we started from the gate, we got all of the rooms and all of the gates together can find together

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,610
the answer.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,350
The second one is the multi source idea that we should hear.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:23,710
Now, let's see the second, the problem, the second, the problem is about there, the Pacific Ocean

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,400
idea here.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,050
So this is problem number two.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,900
Now, this problem is going to be exactly very similar to the previous problem.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,300
Actually, it has the same two components.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,680
First of all.

25
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,460
From the cell perspective, it looks like more like one to one relationship.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,690
Every cell is looking to one exit or a specific direction.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,150
But if you thought it from the ocean perspective, the ocean would like to find here the ocean.

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,880
Like this one here, it would look to find all of the sensors that can reach you to me.

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,780
So if we revisit the problem, we think about the start from the ocean and the find all of the energy

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,100
that can reach to this ocean.

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,460
This would have it also splitting the problem to two problems.

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,080
We would like to split it.

33
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,320
One problem to find like from the best of caution, which are all of the nodes that can the rest of

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,990
ocean can reach it, Richard.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,260
And also, we can do it from there other ocean perspective.

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,140
We find all of them is that it can reach it.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
So the processing goes as following.

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
There are a lot of nodes here.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,430
These are my starting points, I will use them.

40
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,190
And in a business, I find all of them is that I can reach in a very, very similar way.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,850
These are all my starting points.

42
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,820
I will use them to find all of the notes that I can.

43
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,400
I can reach in this way.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,920
If a note is reachable from massive and also reachable from Atlantic, that it must be part of the answer.

45
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,320
So again, this problem ended up like.

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,840
You thought, reversely, which is something very specific to the problem.

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,230
And more importantly, you have multiple starting points now one catch about the reversing ideas when

48
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,760
you reversed something which are the effect on the problem in the normal problem.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,430
You are thinking that the sale will go to the neighbour because if I am five, it would be five or more

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,840
or less.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,790
So it should be less than or equal me.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
Now we are reversing.

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,310
So we would like the ocean to go to the hood so the ocean will go to the road if and only if the ocean

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,860
is greater than or equal to it.

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,870
So in the normal direction, less than or equal in their reverse direction, it would be greater than

56
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,680
or equal.

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
So just be careful about the flipping of the semantic.

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,290
Everything else is just a matter of cutting.

59
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,820
Let's see how to do that.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,680
Two billion array Pacific and Atlantic with the grid the size, and then we would like to find the starting

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,130
cells.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,050
So I'm iterating on the rule, getting the first through and through and getting the first two columns

63
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,010
and the last the column.

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,970
This now could.

65
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,230
It's my starting points.

66
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,980
I will do two separate business one offs on the Pacific Reachable and the best of starting here and

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,050
the second one on the Atlantic one.

68
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,060
Once we are done with this to be a first, I will read two iterations and there are three.

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,910
If the route is reachable from the massive and reachable from the Atlantic, then it's part of the answer.

70
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:27,340
For the BFC itself, it is very straightforward here, observe we add all of the cells to the graph.

71
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,900
So this is the first the change.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,860
The second exchange change, this one should be queue that size.

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,560
So this way we are done with it.

74
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,260
Anything else is the same, but observers here.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,880
The condition here must be ruled in a reverse way so that the this is this is more about the reversing

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,900
the idea, this two about the, uh, about the change itself in the.

77
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,810
In the multi source in the third, the problem.
