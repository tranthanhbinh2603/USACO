1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:08,980
The first homework in the office, the first one, I would like you to modify the lecture to bring to

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,780
the best from the starting A. zero to every other note.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,150
So here is an example.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:22,660
This is this is a graph as we see we have five nodes, so this is the usual reading style.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,630
You read number of cases, nodes, edges and so on.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,620
So we have your very direct one zero one two three and then two to three and then four to three.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,210
OK, so if we started from I think I was going here from zero, right, yes, from zero, if we started

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,310
from zero, you can see here I'm listing the best from zero to one zero two zero three zero four.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,310
So zero one is just one zero two, just two zero three zero one two three zero four.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,180
There is nothing here.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,580
And here is the bigger graph.

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,910
So we have my notes, so you'll print from one to eight when every note you would bring to the bath.

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,490
So how can you get you get the bath you need?

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,740
You will need some beer and tray and you would need to fill it somehow, and you need to print it somehow.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,440
So this is the first task and it's an easy task.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,840
Don't get scared from it.

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,980
In the second, the problem, we will solve their Grass Valley tree problem firmly in this problem,

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,710
it says you will be given a tree.

19
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,840
OK, so you'll be given a graph and would like to validate if it is true or not.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,580
So the labels would be from zero to one and you would be given it just as usual in Lakewood is just

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,830
two values represented.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,610
There represent the ages and it is actually an undirected tree and and values zero based.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,090
You are literally true only if this is a valid tree.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,720
OK?

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,180
If there are no silver loops or remitted edges, and I would like you to use fence, we definitely can

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,990
implement that with the defense believes a stick to using us as much as you can during their the homework

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,680
of this section.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,090
So here is a graph.

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,550
Clearly, this is a tree.

30
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,490
Remember the tree?

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,470
There is only single base between every two nodes in the tree.

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,580
There are no cycles.

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,970
OK, so for that, in the second example, here we have, as you see, this isn't a graph, isn't a

34
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,190
tree because we have a cycle here.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,220
And the third problem we would like to do the following we have, uh, let's see an example here, whether

36
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,640
you have a to the matrix and in these two metrics, you have the person and you have food and would

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,970
like to know that how many steps it will take to reach it.

38
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,120
So let's see there again the definition of the problem.

39
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,330
So you would like to to find the shortest birth to any any food cell.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
OK, so how is The Matrix represented?

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,300
You will have only one star which represent your current location.

42
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,180
The hash is the cell food.

43
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,640
You would like to find any one of these multiple ones.

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,750
The zero means that this is a free space so you can move inside this.

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,360
Is this an x represent an obstacle.

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,060
You can move in the four normal directions, and you would like to alternate the shortest path to any

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,960
of the food cell.

48
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,270
So the the closest one to you?

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,910
Otherwise, you return minus one.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,680
So this is the first example.

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,670
It is the second one.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,240
The person here, as is, he cannot go to this one.

53
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,340
And the third example, the person can go here and here, so this is the shortest one here, so there

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,220
are two food cells, but we only need the shortest one, so please, yeah.

55
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,280
Read the full example and verify it.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,180
And here here are more examples, please read and verify.

57
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,590
Yeah, that's sort.
