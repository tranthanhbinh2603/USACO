1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,390
Let's solve the first homework, the first one about money printing, they're bringing their bath,

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,570
and this is actually a symbol of change here.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,650
We started by creating an array that we will call their parents and we initialize it with minus one.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,790
Now.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,690
We expected the following, like, let's say we have a disconnected Gadhafi's following, for example.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,620
And let's say zero one two, and we started from zero.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,780
So expected that no one would have been in zero, not two would have burnt one.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,190
This knew, and this would have been a minus one minus one because they are disconnected and no zero

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,590
would have minus one as this connected.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,290
So what happened here is as normal.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,240
We just add this here line here.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Load of could we see that the parent of the neighbor is currently the parent of the neighbor is current?

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,060
So we are told, for example, food we have here child five, a child, the sixth child seven.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,710
And I am saying that you know what?

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:08,450
The parent of five is food and the parent of six is food, and the parent of seven is four.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,840
So in this way, we are building a building their relationships, and there is an interesting thing

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,710
here to highlight.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,160
I previously told you that in the rooted graph, one way to represent it is just a single area.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,850
Remember that?

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,800
We mentioned before, if you have a tree like zero one here, two and maybe four.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,520
I told you that in a routine directed graph like that, where every node has only one parent we can

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,200
represent, that was an array, right?

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,910
So I can say here that.

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,530
Zero one, two, three four.

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,020
I can see the berrent of zero is minus one parent of two is you parent of one?

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,090
Is you parent of four is two?

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,010
This is minus one here.

28
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,380
So this way we represented the complete three using an array, and this is very compact representation.

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,240
When you think about the parent relationship.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,840
The parent relationship is actually where we are building that we are.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,540
But I cannot say what is the child of zero using a single tree because it cannot work.

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,630
But if every node in I wrote it in a rooted tree has one parent, only we can use this representation.

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,230
So the built array here is actually a tree representation, and it's the best of format because all

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,530
what we need is just weird automobiles.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,250
Now, let's see, how can that help us?

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,530
Let's say we would like to bring to the bath.

37
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,580
OK, so let's give it a very simple example.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,020
Zero.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,050
Go to one.

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,070
Go to two.

41
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,340
Go to three.

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,680
Go to four.

43
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:53,760
So we know that the parent of four three two one zero minus one, let's say I'm asking you to bring

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,030
two for me, the shortest the bath, the bath from zero to four.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
We're going to start way forward here and say, what does your parent?

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,140
Three, OK?

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,310
Three What is your parent to do?

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,100
What is Berrent one one with?

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,890
Is your parent two zero zero?

50
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,140
What is your minus one already, Richard?

51
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,260
So we see the best is three two one zero.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,070
But this is the reverse at Beth.

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,460
We actually need it to be zero one two three.

54
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,570
Why is it reverted?

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,060
Because we started from the four going back to the zero through the parents, so we need to revert to

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,300
that.

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,850
So you have two ways now, either you do that in any threat of way to get the rest and reverse reversal

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,290
or maybe an easier way to do that in the decision how we recurs.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
We start here.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,050
Why not force and then we we recurs on the parent to fool with Jeffrey after we are done from that,

61
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,950
we bring to their current mood.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,030
Remember parenting their triangle in a forward way and in a backward way?

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,650
We did that in the recurring right.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,200
So please, if you aren't confused about why is this recursion is bringing it in the right way?

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,900
Please go ahead and review the, uh, started sprinting in the recursion section.

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,390
By the way, if you got this line here before it would print to three two one zero.

67
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,140
If you bought it after it, it would bring it to zero one two three.

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,510
So this is mainly the first problem about the, uh, about the printing.

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,600
This is all what we did.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,290
We started from this is thought we iterated on all of the values.

71
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,180
If variant of IE equal minus one, it means that we never found the path for it, so we ignored it.

72
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,850
Otherwise we bring into their target, Beth.
