1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,050
Homework, no food.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,880
And in this subset, we would like to address also a new, different type of graphs and before a problem,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,840
so let's see the first one.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,960
Hopefully the easiest among them as following, we have a directed graph.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, every edge has a color, either red or blue.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,800
And there could be even salvages or or better it just here.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,940
No, the point is the following we would like to move from nude to another.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,930
However, the bath must be alternating.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,840
The bath must be alternating.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,480
The request is following.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,320
You would like to return like a list or a vector of integers.

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:56,140
Such a that answer of exit, but isn't the shortest to Bess from node zero to Node X, such that the

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,500
edges must alternate in colors.

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,550
For example, let's see here.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
This is a graph here.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,280
It gives you a list of images and lists of blue edges.

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,350
The list of blue edges here is empty.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,560
The red one or zero two were at one two in a directed graph.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,320
Now here is the answer of a.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,010
Answer of zero is the best from zero to zero.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,320
This one would be always zero.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,980
Answer often is the best from zero to one in alternating way, there is only one edge.

23
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,900
And this is a shortest to dancers one.

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,090
Answer from zero to two is minus one, why?

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,890
Because there is no birth of alternating energies we see here from zero to one in red.

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,120
We needed one to two, but but blue one, not red one.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,260
But it doesn't exist.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,240
So that's why you have mice that wouldn't swim here.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,690
So it isn't about just finding the shortest bath.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,990
The Bath must be alternating in colors.

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:58,360
Another problem here 01 is red, but two one is blue, so zero two zero would be zero zero to one one,

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,320
as we did before.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,300
Zero two even doesn't exist.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,610
Now, let's flip the problem.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,410
What about 012?

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,150
But this way, this one exists, this one is minus one.

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,060
This one is minus one.

38
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,540
I hope the overall idea is clear.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,380
Let's see more example zero, one and two from zero two zero zero from zero to one one in red from zero

40
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,930
to two two edges, but red and blue.

41
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,950
So it's an eternity.

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,500
It has to be like red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or blue or red, the blue red or blue red.

43
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,690
The final example here.

44
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,940
From zero two zero is zero.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,240
From zero to one, there is one edge which is red good from zero to two.

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,690
There is.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,520
One age that is also red, which is also good.

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,580
I hope the overall is clear.

49
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,120
It is shortest to both, but consider the coloring that we have.

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,670
Let's move something that's more generic.

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,940
There is what we call the water and drug problem, and this is a very popular problem and it has different

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,450
variants.

53
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,670
So here is a very, very good website.

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,070
So this is a jug of water and this is a jug of water that is a very popular problem that each one of

55
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,390
them has a capacity to say six liters of water, and this one is eight liters of water.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,320
And you can do any of the following six operations, and you can do them as many as you want.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,750
You have infinitely infinite number of water, by the way.

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,220
This is my description for the problem because the elite could judge a description is very bad.

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,090
You can do the following operation.

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,720
You can fill any of their jugs with water, so this one has a capacity of six and this one has come

61
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,290
too often.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,250
I can fill this one up to six or I can fill this for up to 10.

63
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,440
And definitely can fill both of them.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,410
The second operation you can imagine and one of them.

65
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,180
So this one has six liters of water.

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,760
Now I can empty all of it or can do that.

67
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,040
So as you see, you can empty both of them or can make all of them the full.

68
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,510
Now, the second third operation is this following.

69
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,470
It is a brutal operation.

70
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,760
Um, but let me give you an example.

71
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,950
Let's say that this is judge number one.

72
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,150
Let's see.

73
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,440
The capacity is six.

74
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,490
And let's say it has at the moment, four liters of water only.

75
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:28,890
And let's say that this is another jag of civil leaders, and at the moment it has five liters of food.

76
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,370
If you decided to fill from the first one to the second one, notice that the second one only needs

77
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,930
to your, it's safe.

78
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,490
We bought the from one to two.

79
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,370
We will take two units a year, so it will be felt to seven.

80
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,420
And this one would be reduced up to two units here.

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,350
So it would be only.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,450
Two years here.

83
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,890
So the brutal operation is just following your boat from one to another.

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,490
Tell the the other judge is completely full or the first one is completely empty.

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,600
For example, if we assume that this one is true and this one here is just zero.

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,900
So what you can do is build that tool to the zero here, so this one would be two and this one would

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,710
be zero.

88
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,680
The operation is very loose contract to understand that from this perspective, now what is the request?

89
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,030
You will be given a target committee and you would like to play this operation as much as you can,

90
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,610
such as that at some point of time.

91
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,830
The water in the first one blows the water, and the second one equally equals the target capacity.

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,500
By the way, in some of other online judges, you would like one of them only to be equal to you.

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,310
But in this variant, and it could, you need the plus, OK?

94
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,400
So this is merely the request you keep believing and return it through if you can reach a stage where

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,360
that the sum of the two of them is exactly the tiger Kristie.

96
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,050
One of the problem here, the values are extremely huge.

97
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,960
So this is really there the problem?

98
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,650
So let me give you my examples of some examples.

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,820
The first one has one.

100
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,230
And the second one has to.

101
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,860
If you filled this one to one and this one to two, then the submission is three, which is the request.

102
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,380
If the first haston and the second has 20, then even when they are both failed, the submission is

103
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,890
just a throw when we need 100, so we no way to reach that.

104
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,490
OK.

105
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,740
If you would like to reach a three with three and five to six.

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,280
So here's what what we can do.

107
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,620
So let's say let's try to draw.

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,010
We have here.

109
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,200
Three units of water and we have here five units of water.

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:49,210
So here is this tips, first of all, I will start by filling the the first one, I will fill the second

111
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,480
one.

112
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,540
So the second one has five, so I will fill all of it.

113
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,040
So now we have five units here.

114
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,790
Then I will boot from two to one.

115
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,210
So now this one has five units Ubu two here.

116
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,550
So this one has three.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,950
Also, it will be folded two three units and what remaining is just two then.

118
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,210
You, well, empathy, their second one, so we empty this one here.

119
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,760
Then brewed from one to two.

120
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,970
So take this three Yorkshire and Muslims thought now this one would be three.

121
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,080
Now, Phil, the first one, again it will be three.

122
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Again, No three and three are six.

123
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,390
An important observation here.

124
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,090
The answer of three, five and six is true.

125
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,470
So the answer, also five and three, is also true.

126
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,820
OK, so this is mainly the problem as an extra thing.

127
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,610
If you would like to do that, you might even try to change your could to bring to the shortest operations

128
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,330
a sequence which is as simple as a bath that we printed before.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,080
Look, one thing here that it could limits are very tight limit.

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,020
It's more or less like competitive programming.

131
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,170
It's like 90 percent your school goodwill Tilley mine were not really, but you will still almost most.

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,370
This problem has an all one solution.

133
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,210
It's wisdom, mathematics, and it's out of our scope completely.

134
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,410
Now, I don't want you to get in this puzzle of a lot of time.

135
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,510
Limit exceeds and waste a lot of your time in that.

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,320
So here is what I'm doing and providing you with my own training.

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,360
File my own book fight.

138
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,830
So it is an example of them.

139
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,690
But while it is stuck to the number of cases, then it lines each other and has no to cases.

140
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,300
So read and compare with your own one.

141
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,240
Maybe you can write some script to convert two files together.

142
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,890
So this is mainly what you can do for free to try to optimize your code to best the tiddly.

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,190
You have to avoid any slow competitors.

144
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,060
You have to make some optimizations so that it can best simply.

145
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,400
OK, so the next one, the sliding bottle.

146
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,820
Uh, a nice problem.

147
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,810
OK, it is what you have.

148
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:12,370
You will be given a two or three sliding buzzer like that, for example, then, but there is one two

149
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,370
three four and then zero and then five.

150
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:24,280
The request is we would like the grade to end up as following.

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,560
We would like the grade to be one, two, three, four, five and zero.

152
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,410
So this is the issue state and this is the final state.

153
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
Now what is operation?

154
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,570
You search for the zero and you can swab it with any one of their neighbors of the four neighbors of

155
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:40,810
it.

156
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,420
And would like to return, I think the shortest number of steps.

157
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,310
The lowest number of steps.

158
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,360
So this is so you would be given an initial goal.

159
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,260
And this is the target goal.

160
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:59,130
And you can swab with any of the adjacent to value the zero only and return the total number of steps

161
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,000
or minus one.

162
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,860
If no way to do that.

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,440
It is an example, please read it and try to see how can we move it?

164
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:15,660
The zero is here, so we can, for example, and the first one it will slide what, uh, four one two

165
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,920
five zero three.

166
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,850
This is the initial one.

167
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:24,900
It when it's light five years or bring five years or it is a zero, and then it will do what it will,

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,960
uh, zero one two.

169
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,060
So it slides zero above and Brentford here and so on.

170
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,100
Another example.

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,050
Then fix the problem.

172
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,850
Make sure to fully understand this problem, who is quoting so that you don't get puzzled about what

173
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,940
is what and read it after I explain it.

174
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,950
You have in the boxes.

175
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,360
Each books has the following information.

176
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,580
It has a status for its A.

177
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,300
So if the status is one, it means it is an up in the books.

178
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,820
If the zero is the close, the books, there are some candies that are inside the books.

179
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,830
Seven Candies, it candies.

180
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,740
There are some keys inside the books.

181
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,990
I can take these keys and open in another book, so with it that need this key.

182
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,220
And inside the books, there are more boxes.

183
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,960
OK, so be careful about that.

184
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,480
But there are almost one books inside e-books, so when you open a box?

185
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,310
You'll find that it might be open or closed.

186
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,090
You'll find some sweet candies inside it.

187
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,030
You'll find some keys inside it.

188
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,820
You'll find even some books inside it.

189
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,610
But but this box is my because that might be open to you, the know.

190
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,660
Now here is the point you would like to you.

191
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,230
Initially, you would be initially given.

192
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,690
You would be initially given some boxes that are you can start with them.

193
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,680
OK.

194
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,840
So you can take all of the candies.

195
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,950
And so this initial boxes consider them, they are opened in a way.

196
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:10,540
And now what you would like to do is you will keep taking Candice from the books and all of the keys

197
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,950
in the books and keep searching for other books.

198
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,970
Any books so that you can it, you open it, then take the candies inside it, then take the keys inside

199
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,120
it.

200
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,210
Open more books as long as your current keys allow you to open a new box up in the box.

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,260
Take the candies.

202
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,780
Get the keys of in boxes inside it.

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,880
Keep doing that until reaching the status where you cannot open any more boxes.

204
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,500
Now, return to the total number of candies that you can collect this way.

205
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,200
Overall, it could be confusing a problem.

206
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,920
I will.

207
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,820
I will leave it for you to try to simulate the examples and understand them.

208
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,920
Uh, yeah.

209
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,860
Also read this description in is it could be helpful for you while coding.

210
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,620
Uh, don't be scared.

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,260
Not that hard.

212
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,450
Just make sure you understand the details of the problem.

213
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,770
That's off.
