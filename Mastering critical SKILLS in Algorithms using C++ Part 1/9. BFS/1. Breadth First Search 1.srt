1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,330
In this section, we will move to another type of traversal algorithms, which is the breadth first

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:14,980
search similar to the dips, a first search, the first search is at reversing algorithm.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,370
It works for directed graphs, for undirected graphs.

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:25,630
But let's remember the defense was exploring the nodes as deep as possible, and that's why we got a

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,680
depth of research.

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,440
This news here doesn't represent the nodes.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,900
It represents the exploration order.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,950
If we are starting at this node, which may be in fact, the number 17 or whatever, we keep going deeper

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,430
and deeper.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,070
So this is where the algorithm keep going.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,860
It say, Hey, do you have children?

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,130
Yes, two.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,900
Oh, recursive two.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,470
Do you have a child?

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,710
Yes.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,120
Three Because they're three.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,680
Do you have a child?

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,850
Yes, requested and so on.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,090
Who in four say, I don't have any children that recursion go back to three, which jump into the next

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,430
chart, which you then go back and so on.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:09,210
So this is the order of the defense, the defense keep going as deep as possible and then return, then

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,210
go deeper.

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,190
Return.

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,540
Go deeper.

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,410
Return.

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,100
Gordemer return.

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,830
Gordemer return.

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,500
We are done.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,050
This is a depth first search and we solve it a lot.

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,200
I expect that you understand very clearly what I'm saying here.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,830
Now, what about the B s the B?

32
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,440
If this is a breath, the first search algorithm?

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,080
Remember, we explained the difference between the two words.

34
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,700
So b a face explodes at the graph level by level.

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,720
Specifically, we discover the nodes in the following order.

36
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,190
So we are here.

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,330
What is the next level two and the three weeks of these two first?

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,420
Then what is the next level four, five and six weeks ago this first, then seven eight nine 10.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,090
So this one next and then this one next.

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,740
So the defense, the B a first go level by level.

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,620
So now we have two approaches that are inspired from how we as human think.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,770
Remember when to give you the top story?

43
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:16,150
Like, we have topic like mathematics, we have topic like maybe biology, maybe we have physics.

44
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,110
And then there are hundred books a year.

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,940
Hundred books are here, 200 books are here.

46
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,580
In the depths of her research, she will take the mass to finish it first, then take biology topic

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,780
first and finish it first.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,000
Then the physics, go back and finish it first.

49
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,580
In the first state, you will finish one book for math, then one book for biology, then one book from

50
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,720
physics, then another book from math, another book from biology and another book from physics.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,650
And so.

52
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:50,050
I hope the life phenomena and the corresponding one in the algorithms are clear for you, so it is clearly

53
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,060
the difference between them.

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:59,200
This one is a DFS and this one is a farce that the depth of research explored deep well why the physics

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,810
of lower level by bite of it.

56
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,090
Remember, this nodes doesn't represent the node values that they represent the exploration order.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,840
OK, so this is mainly what is the first doing.

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,520
So what is the level of a node like when they say you were level by level?

59
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,910
We can clearly see here because I structured, I drew the graph to look like a level by living graph.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,950
In practice, maybe node number one would be here, rule number two here, rule number three here,

61
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,090
node number six here.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,490
When you draw the graph this way, it doesn't see where are the levels now?

63
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,630
I drew the graph to look like the levels from the perspective of node number one.

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,290
So the level here represented the shortest to Abarth.

65
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,380
So we know really what is a Beth, which represents like when I say, one two five 10.

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,130
This is above the shortest represent about ability in the graph itself.

67
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,100
So there are usually two facts for the shortest the values sometimes which is here.

68
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,350
It represented the total number of edges.

69
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,080
For example, when you think about node number nine, there is only one Beth actually from one to nine,

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
which is one two five nine.

71
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,920
We needed three edges.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,270
We see the shortest.

73
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,770
The Beth from one to nine is three in a similar way.

74
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:20,440
The church, the best from one to seven, is one two three again, three edges.

75
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,580
So this is the definition of the shortest path, and later we would learn about the orchestra.

76
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,530
In the second part of this course, we will learn about the other definitions of the shortest Sabbath.

77
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,500
So.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,990
So now I hope the the word level and the word the shortest Beth are clear for you.

79
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,370
It represents the number of edges from a starting node to an ending or from a source to a destination.

80
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,380
This is what are the levels.

81
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,920
So let's see some visualization on a general graph now.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,660
No, I don't get I don't drew the graph to.

83
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,680
Looks like a good for you.

84
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,210
So here is a graph.

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,750
Let's say you would like to start and do it first from node number two.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,730
So here is no, no, no, no to.

87
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,030
Now, Newt number two level is just zero.

88
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,120
The distance from zero to two is just you.

89
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:14,880
Which nodes do you think are at level number one, which means that the shortest bus is just one inch?

90
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,890
Can you spot them?

91
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:27,960
These nodes are node number one and seven and the food and the five specifically, they are the neighbors,

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,770
the food number two.

93
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,270
So they are good neighbors who neighbors represent nodes at level number one.

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,290
OK.

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,890
So as you see the this, the best now is just one step.

96
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,180
OK.

97
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,900
What about what about the rules that live in No.

98
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,280
Two, can you spot them?

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,190
There was no number two is three and six and zero.

100
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,910
So when you look to two, it takes two to two to three.

101
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,510
It takes two ages to reach six.

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,370
It takes two edges to reach zero.

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:08,820
Observe the following, uh, like, for example, nude number six, we can reach it using here one bathroom

104
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,890
from two to four to five to six.

105
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,810
This takes three steps, but we cannot stretch from two to five to six.

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,290
And remember, we seek the shortest to bath.

107
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,590
So the answer is about the one that is closer to me.

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,770
So the the closest way is this way.

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,090
Now your turn?

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,000
What about their level three?

111
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,380
Clearly, River three comes from node number seven here, which is as you.

112
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,530
Let's take another example.

113
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,020
This is thought to be a first from the number seven now, which, you know, at level one, just the

114
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,190
number zero, which, you know, at level two, just no food.

115
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,720
Which, you know, at level three.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,590
Just include two and seven and five.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,740
I would like you to observe the relationship between the news that we visited so far and the news that

118
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,220
are new for us, for example, who target news, no food.

119
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,860
You will not see this.

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,400
This is harvested bullet.

121
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,240
This is the unvisited booked.

122
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,090
So now some of the unvisited board will join our our our, our joint, our vested group.

123
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,840
So you see here Newt, number five Ken and number six from here and also can add new number three from

124
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,050
here.

125
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,270
Number two can add Newt number one here.

126
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,860
So we see that in.

127
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,670
Uh, let me go one step.

128
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,580
Uh.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,610
Uh, one, two, three four.

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,100
I should add three, was you with us here?

131
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,310
So three should be added in this in this graph, OK?

132
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,080
There are no nodes at level five.

133
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:43,890
OK.

134
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,510
Three is already part of level four.

135
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,420
OK, I think one more example, yeah, here.

136
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,720
So let's see here one more.

137
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,870
I'm just trying to make you familiar with the idea of the of the Liberals now he had no one.

138
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,340
Where are the nudes at level number one?

139
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,820
Clearly, the neighbors, which are three and five and six, now live in number two.

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,290
So you see now nude number seven will join through number six.

141
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,620
Nude number two can join through number five.

142
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,010
So we see now they are added now at level number three.

143
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,530
Nude number four can come either from here or from here.

144
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,190
I hope you spot the relationship, not number zero two, the nude number seven.

145
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,610
I hope you get the idea of the levels in the next session.

146
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,280
We will show how to do that in a very systematic way.
