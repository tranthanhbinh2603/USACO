1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,100
Homework number two.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,350
And the first problem which is jumping, getting a game.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:15,590
So we have an array of non negative integers and these are a specific starting index in this array.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,920
And there are some values with values zero.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,250
And I would like to jump from the index to that any index that has a value zero.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
OK, so how can we jump?

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:36,400
We can move to if we are at Index I, we can move to Ibrox or if I or I too early, minus RFI RFI.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:47,100
So from any position you can only go to I Blosser if I or I minus reapply it now.

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,850
You would like to know.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,260
If.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,250
This is both civil war, not can you end up at any of these indices or not?

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,380
So let's see an example here.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,940
In the first example you say, the starting index is index number five.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,070
So zero one two three four five.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,360
We start to hear.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,840
At this index.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,300
Now.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,390
We would like to see where are the values of values here?

19
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,430
We have only one values zero here, which is here.

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,040
This one should be.

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,690
Here is zero one two three four five.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,160
This is the starting index, and this is the current.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
This is a good index, so we search for the zeros.

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,030
Any of the zeros is a target for us.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,080
So this is zero.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,870
So the question is, can we start from five?

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,470
And in the three indices, the operation is to increment yourself with the value or subtract the value.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,940
So we start at five.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,350
The value of five is one.

31
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,010
So we either go five plus one or five minus one.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,180
If we go to five minus one, which is at Index Food Index, what has a value three?

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,240
So you have two choices either you go.

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,070
Four minus three or four plus three for Flossie is out of the array for minus three is four, minus

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,540
three is just one.

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,620
Now we add in this one here at index one here, the index one has a value two, so it means we can either

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,590
go one plus two or one minus two.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,260
Woman two is that out of that, a one plus two three, which is a go.

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,370
So as you see, we can go from index five to index of three with this sequence.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,630
And here is another way.

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:39,630
So you are you will return it to if you can follow this operation, whatever how and find your destination

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,550
or what we need to do is to go from the starting index to the ending index.

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,020
So what is the graph?

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,940
This is a question that you have to answer.

45
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,340
More examples are here for you to think about them.

46
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,890
In the second, the problem, we will have a number, so we will have a sorry, we will have an array.

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,070
The array has distinct numbers and you have a starting values thought and you have an ending value goes.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,260
And here is what you should do.

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,850
You would like to start from X and keep changing it with operations to end the op the good.

50
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,920
OK, what are this operation?

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,090
How can we change the number?

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
You cannot change it by the following.

53
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,040
First of all, for any X in this range.

54
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,950
You can try any index in the array and then you have three operation, either adding numbers of AI or

55
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,970
subtracting numbers of AI or soaring numbers of AI.

56
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,980
If you don't know what is X or like, what is X or B, just write it and think of it as a like plus

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,400
minus asterisk division or prediction.

58
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,530
Just an operation at the time, and it's Betway celebratory.

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,890
So let me explain the Tuskegee.

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
You have a starting number.

61
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,880
And you have an ending, no.

62
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,200
So here is a start.

63
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,610
And here is the goal, and we cannot change the start to another number.

64
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,010
Let's say the renames has five values.

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,920
Then you can change it to five different values.

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,500
And for everybody who can agree to change it to other five bags, but the only condition is the new

67
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,220
oxygenated must be between zero and 1000.

68
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,590
OK, so it is a case we have the starting six and would like to end at four.

69
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,180
The values are one or three.

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,730
So we either add one two six or subtracted or explore it.

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,290
So these are the three operation here.

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,120
Now, if we can go six seven four, using first exhorting was one, then second exploding with three.

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,580
Here is another case you start from.

74
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,810
Two would like to go to 12.

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,880
Now we can.

76
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:10,780
Add to the 212, this move us to 14, then we can subtract two from the 14 to this end up with, uh,

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,710
12.

78
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,090
Which is a good I hope you good idea.

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,550
So again, it looks like we have a bunch of numbers, have bunch of operations would like to model that

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,090
as a graph.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,070
How can we do that?

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,990
More examples for you to trace.

83
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:37,250
And then the problem you have a string, the string represent a look, if you go to the gym, you probably

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,240
see, so she looks a lot.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,210
Each look is like a fool for circular wheels, if you will.

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,130
From them is just digits from zero tonight.

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,540
And then it has a best one.

88
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,710
Maybe, for example, the best one is two one seven zero.

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
So this is the best one of your look.

90
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,660
If you roll the the values so that they are two one seven zero is going to open.

91
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,770
So the problem is as following we start from this drink zero zero zero zero and we would like to go

92
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,870
to this target maybe two one seven zero with the minimum number of steps.

93
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,360
So each step would involve just you can take a value and push it forward or backward.

94
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,620
So for example, if I have a zero zero zero zero and I would like two two one seven zero if I push this

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,620
zero two steps and this zero one a step and the seven seven steps, then we have in total 10 steps to

96
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,520
reach to this state.

97
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,600
But this is so straight forward it is the catch in this problem.

98
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,390
There are some dead ends.

99
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,990
Some states, maybe, for example, two one one zero, for example, it's a dead end.

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,380
If if it happened that you'd look at best with this number, it will get logged and you cannot open

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,910
it anymore.

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,100
So you have to avoid thing by any of these dead ends.

103
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:02,440
So the problem again, you start to from this four zeros, you would like to go to the target here such

104
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,580
that you don't best buy this dead ends and you have to do that with the minimum number of steps.

105
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,230
So here is the target zero two zero two and you cannot iterate on any of these values.

106
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,930
So one sequence would be take zero zero.

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,910
Change it at one here.

108
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,480
One step.

109
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,710
Another one here.

110
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,360
Another step.

111
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,200
Then this one here or the step.

112
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,520
Then this one here.

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,230
So another step and then removing this one from here in the system.

114
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,500
So as you see, we ended up with one very big choice.

115
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,650
But this sequence, for example, is invalid.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,610
Why?

117
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,690
Because we iterated on the value zero one zero two in the middle and zero one zero two is here as it

118
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,540
did, and you cannot iterate over it.

119
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,470
So this is mainly what you need.

120
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,430
Uh, this is Mindy.

121
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,380
What you need to do?

122
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,240
Observe the following.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:07,010
In the problem paid, it's say that you can move forward and backward as you want, you can move forward

124
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,260
and backward, as you, as you would like.

125
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,730
Say the truth here that the wheels can rotate freely and wrap around.

126
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,340
This means that nine can be go to zero and zero can go to nine.

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,410
OK, so here you see, the last example here is just is zero zero zero nine.

128
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,200
So if I have zero zero zero zero and then fled this one one step backward, it will be zero zero zero

129
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,200
nine in a single in a single step.

130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,270
So this is mainly the problem.

131
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,440
More examples for you.

132
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,040
Please consider this examples because because this puts because it could has some of the special cases.

133
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,110
I don't want you to keep getting wrong answers.

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,000
So consider this once while cutting your approach that sort.
