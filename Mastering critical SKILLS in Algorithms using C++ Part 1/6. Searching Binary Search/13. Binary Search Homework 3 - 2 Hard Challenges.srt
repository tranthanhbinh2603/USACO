00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's see homework number three, which is a bit harder than the previous ones in the first task.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,280
We would like to find the first, the missing and not the missing, not the first.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,800
The Keith missing element in a binary search right now.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,040
Let me first extend learned little more here.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,550
We have an array for seven, nine, 10, starting from four.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,170
What are the missing elements?

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,290
We have four, then five is missing, six is missing, we have seven, then eight is missing, we have

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,760
nine and we have 10.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,300
So five is the first missing number six is the second.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,620
Missing number eight is a third, the missing number considering only the beginning here.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,310
Now the function will give you the array and give you equal one and ask you to find the fifth missing

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,950
element, which you hear is clearly number five.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,630
OK, what about here?

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,440
Take one three.

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,670
The third the missing element is key equal eight here.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,570
What about this one?

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,410
We have one.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,790
Then we have two.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,990
Three is missing.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,340
Four we have four.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,450
Five is missing, six is missing, seven is missing.

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,490
And so now it asks us for the third, the missing element, which is six here.

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,500
So this is mainly the problem.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,820
This problem can be solved with the number two, by the way, is are sorted.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,420
This problem can be solved with an end could in a normal way.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,480
I would suggest for you to try to write it, but I would like you to develop an all look in brain research

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
approach for this problem.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,680
The next the problem is following, and it's a very interesting problem.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,190
This is a multiplication table, right?

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,340
Like let's you know, when the normal multiplication table is usually midterms and when we were kids.

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,030
So now this is a multiplication table for M equals three and inequality, which means you try you start

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:01,330
to say one times, one one times, two one times or three two times one two times to two times or three

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,380
three times one three times, two, three times or three.

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,380
This is a normal multiplication table of three times the three.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:17,560
So the problem will give you two numbers M and N, which are there the dimension of the table.

36
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,330
It could be, for example, two and five.

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,320
So you say two times one, two times two, blah blah blah up to 2005 and so on.

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,840
Now, let's say, after we built this table, we put it in one diary and sorted all of them.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,100
Now, the function would give you a key.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,530
No, you're turning the key element in this one array.

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,960
So here is the problem again, the problem fixed itself like you will be given Mandan, which are a

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,250
bit big and key, which it would be in times in the range and you would like to find the key, the smallest

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,090
element in there, MS terms in the multiplication key, the smallest element in the multiplication.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,850
In other words, if you flatten the array, the to the array and one the and all of them, we need the

45
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,040
key value from here.

46
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,840
Here is another example.

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,060
Um, we have two times the three metrics we wrote, the values we wrote them here.

48
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,250
We thought to them, we need number six.

49
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,710
So here is the sixth element in this list.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,450
So as you see, the two problems are both the key element, but from two different perspectives.

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,870
These are merely the two problems for we have the challenges.
