1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:07,960
Another important generalization to know about it is that binary search can actually work on real values.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,970
Let's start with a simple problem.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,570
We have an issue of excessive which has this equation.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,240
I would like to find the root for this equation.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,680
This mean I would like to find an X where f of X is zero.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,380
Now I'm telling you an information that X is guaranteed to be in the range two.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,710
Three.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,340
The answer to this function is going to be a real no.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,230
Maybe something like 1.5 or so.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
So now I would like to find X.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,330
Can we begin research that to begin the research on it, first of all, you need to prove that F of

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,030
X is monotonic function.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,490
And then you need to modify the binary search, good to start to work on real values.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,560
I would like you to take the challenge and try to change the code by yourself to solve this problem.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,110
OK.

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,200
Let's think about how to do it.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,510
Practically speaking, there is no magic this thought and in the variables would be double.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,640
We need a possible function to guide the search and we need to prove it is correct and one panic.

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,100
Uh, and that's it.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,630
The only the only new concern is actually about how to stop the coup, which isn't that hard.

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,860
Let's start with the FAA function.

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,570
They function when you think about it, you have food to the power to the board.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,740
Seven and X were given for us and the range zero to three.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,080
So this term almost must be a positive value.

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,330
And this one is also another was the value.

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,040
And this is a negative value.

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,830
This means that this equation must be increasing.

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,810
Mathematically must be increasing.

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,940
If you are in doubt from that, you can simply write the function and just try a bunch of conservative

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,360
values.

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,820
So when you try to see here the Albert, you just notice it is an increasing output.

32
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,360
So now we are sure that this function is increasing, which means we can use it to guide our search,

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,400
for example it.

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,460
Yeah.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,450
Yeah, anyway, let's let's keep going here.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
It is the way their search function.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,470
First of all, I have is thought, is you and equal?

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,790
Three, because the already told me the limit.

39
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,030
If the problem didn't tell you, you have to figure it out, you're starting it for a while.

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,630
Assume that it's just a zero.

41
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,460
So in the minus is third in the minus third greater than zero.

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,230
This is as simple as sending that ended the opposite side.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,030
So to be is, is this then?

44
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,720
Uh, yeah.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,170
As long as as long as start is this, then it is set, isn't it?

46
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,400
So this is exactly, um, the normal condition.

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,350
The middle is, as we used to do.

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,740
Now let's think about our guidance for the function.

49
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,910
We say if if of middle Lisbon zero.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,680
So let's say we tried X, for example, by half, for example.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,110
Now let's say that x of half give us something like f of x, give us something like minus 20.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
Now this is more than zero, but we just need zero.

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,920
So it means we need to drop the first part of the search observer here.

54
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,590
We will not try to start equal mid +1 because we are working on real values.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,490
So we'll just say start equal mode.

56
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,160
There is no plus one or minus one in more in 3D values and a very similar way.

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,420
Let's say the next time X was like 2.5.

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,230
If EXA-, for example, turned out to be 170, this is way beyond the zero that we need.

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,120
So this mean we need to drop the second part of the search so we right and equal zero.

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,770
As you see, this is how we use the function to guide the search.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,520
But when it comes to assigning we just right start and end.

62
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,670
Now, let's go back to this condition, it's all about comparison of the double values.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,990
We know that in this problem that start and end are at the zero and zero and an issue that is greater

64
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,470
than zero.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,750
But Wood Lake wants to start and end are very, very close.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,630
I cannot say, or I'll start, uh, just to just to greater than I could to just see that.

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,830
Because in real values, as you learned in the programming, the real values cannot be compared this

68
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,160
way.

69
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,430
So we need to compare this to an episode in which is a very small value.

70
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,690
This refers to the C++ course or Google that about how to convert double numbers.

71
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,390
So and this is just one way.

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,200
So the moral of that is, we say, as long as there is some error difference between them greater than

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,630
Epsilon, then that's we still keep going.

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,040
If once it become Lisbon Epsilon, but what does Epsilon Epsilon is a very, very, very small value.

75
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,720
So let's say the difference at some point becomes something like zero point zero zero to three, which

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,950
is a smaller than this value.

77
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,270
Now we know we can stop.

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
So this is a model of one domain estate.

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,830
So why?

80
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,790
Why it's minus nine?

81
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,010
Why not one e to minus 15?

82
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,520
What not?

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
Why items in a seven?

84
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,590
It's up to you.

85
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,430
And I would say some clarification about that right now.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,330
Observer here there is no middle +1 middle minus one anymore.

87
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,510
Look, I would like to say some notes about competitive programming here.

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,290
First of all, sometimes you will find the problem, saying the answer should be within absolute error

89
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,120
of 10 to the bar minus nine.

90
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,740
What does this statement mean?

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,390
It meets if he were to take the flute absolute off your real answer?

92
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,590
And their answer?

93
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,410
I make sure it is equal to the bar minus light.

94
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,820
And here in the bonus research, you would like to put the smaller value so that you guarantee you are

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,050
very close to the answer.

96
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,260
If you use something like 10 to the minus minus five, for example, your error difference would be

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,360
greater than 10 to the minus nine.

98
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,130
I hope that this isn't hard for you to get.

99
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,310
I would like to tell you about some things that people do in competitions, and also it's good for others

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,910
to know about them.

101
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,980
First of all, many people than just a competitor start an industry that they use the flute obsidian

102
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,470
to avoid any kind of maybe possible overflows or infinite loops.

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,170
So they, because those are maybe like any anything, could have it in the double values they they use

104
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,250
the flute absolute to make sure that this one is always boasted value.

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,680
The second thing which is very important in programming competitions and many problems is still the

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,140
competition based on the absolute value is wrong.

107
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,490
So there is a trick here.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:53,690
People replace the way loop of the absolute value by iterating maybe like 100 or 200 steps.

109
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,780
This guarantees that after 100 or 200 steps of dividing by two of the social space, that the error

110
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,840
difference between your answer and that answer is very small.

111
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,280
For example, your answer could be 1.5 five three one seven one eight two three, and their answer could

112
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,460
be 1.5 to three one seven one eight zero one.

113
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,120
So the only difference comes here in the last two digits, maybe.

114
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,340
So the model of that is instead of making it depending on the comparisons, which might be a bit tricky.

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,310
You depend on the iteration.

116
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,470
You'll find a lot of people just using the plus in the other two because the overflow problems are in

117
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,700
the big when it comes to the real values in most of the programming competitions.

118
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,640
But if something fancy that I almost never did did it before.

119
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,620
In some problems, if the left and right are greater than one, people use the square root of the multiplication

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,820
and they claim that this do for the conversions during my computer program create.

121
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,700
I never needed that, but in a way I just wanted you to know about it.

122
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm showing you this good, but don't get it wrong.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,230
I don't mean that this is good.

124
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,650
It's better.

125
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:00,860
Good.

126
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,330
I'm just showing you what I was just meaning I started this good year with Epsilon because I wanted

127
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,170
to multiply the start times and otherwise it would keep being zero answer.

128
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,010
And sometimes people return to their average of the start and end.

129
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,210
Not just the start, but but they never needed that.

130
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,500
Uh, and here is what I meant by the fruit absolute in the equation.

131
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,780
But if you are in programming competition, I suggest for you more to do it this way.

132
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,230
Iterate 100 iterations or 200 iterations and tell you reach the reason.

133
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,460
So if that is something you should borrow from this slide, it would be under this line.

134
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,060
17.

135
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,690
Because many problems would be wrong answers or maybe time limit exceed.

136
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,690
But this equation will just solve the problem for you.

137
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,740
That's it.
