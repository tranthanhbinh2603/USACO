1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,050
In this video, you will learn how to generalize the body in the research.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,270
So far, we will learned how to apply by the research on a certain array.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:23,400
We learned three things to find the number in general or find the first index or find their lust index.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,360
This is wrong.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,900
The last index for it now, binary search can actually work on functions.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,430
Specific categories can function with its code.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,980
Monotonic functions will come back to this definition.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,730
The binary search youcould will be still very systematic.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,670
We use almost the same code from a problem to another.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,040
But the key is to figure out how to do that.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,520
Let's go back to the range of problem.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,210
Usually, when we are trying to work on functions, we need to define a function and we need to define

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,010
a Boolean function based on it.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,260
Sometimes they are just written as a one function.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,300
Sometimes they are written as two separate functions.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,310
So let me introduce a simple function for you here.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:16,320
Counter is a function that are for rules and return the total number of coins that if we try to fill

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,000
the rows from one to end.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,610
For example, if are equal three, then I would like to serve three rows, which needs one +2 +3 coins.

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,590
So this function should return at six.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,140
So count of three is six.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,330
As you see, this is a very trivial function, which is our actually our times of virtue.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:36,840
That's it.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,170
So this is the accounting function that I defined here.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,930
No, the Boolean function, which is very important here.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,090
The function visible of our in what are is the rules and in is the current.

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,940
The coins would return it true if and only if any coins are enough to cover.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
There are rules, for example, here.

29
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,490
Yeah, but yeah, for simplicity, the function is just returning if greater than or equal to counteract.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,060
So let's see here it is a table, but all by rule, we have the count of AH, which is just submission

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,350
from one, two or so.

32
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,580
For example, count to five is 15, which is one two three four five.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,130
No, the visible function is digging and again, it cleans cover one rule.

34
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,210
Definitely, yes.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,680
Can it go into cover two rows?

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,270
Definitely.

37
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,740
Yes, because we just need three.

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,420
Can eight coins to cover three rows?

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,020
Yes, because we just need six coins and we have eight.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,810
Can it coins the cover tin?

41
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,090
Can it coins the cover for rows?

42
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,280
No, because then we need 10 coins, but we only have eight.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,630
So that is missing here too.

44
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,680
So false.

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,100
Can five rules be covert, false?

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,570
There's a question for you here.

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,900
Do you expect an answer for any role greater than five?

48
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,200
The answer is false.

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,200
Starting from four, we cannot do it, and we definitely, if we cannot cover for rules, we definitely

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,450
cannot cover anything else, anything more than that.

51
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,300
This is something very important to keep in mind.

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,040
Now I would like you to look to the Boolean function.

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,410
The binary search, is it still working and actually win a race?

54
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,910
But now with the array is a virtual array the array is following.

55
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,980
The race has a bunch of truths.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,420
It's a virtual array.

57
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,560
So let's let's make it here.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,230
We have an array, a virtual array.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,550
At index, one answer is to index it, to answer it's through index or straight through from index of

60
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,940
four.

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,300
The answer is false, false, false and so on.

62
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,640
So a bunch of truths.

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,070
There are many forces now when you think about it.

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,620
I actually knew need the lust or cadence of true in the array.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,910
We need this one.

66
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,330
Now we can write a good for binary search using exactly the same logic on binary circular arrays.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,900
But this time we would imagine the array.

68
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,810
OK, what are the values of the array?

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,330
The values of the three are Boolean values.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,070
They are coming from the possible function, which we based here on the counting thing.

71
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,890
I would like you to try to code it in binary search.

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,770
Be careful when submitting on it.

73
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,490
Good because the limit is two to the bar 31 minus one, so it might overflow with you.

74
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,650
OK, let's see, liquid.

75
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,070
First of all, let's develop the possible function.

76
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,700
The Blues will function when tick and and tick the rules, it compute the total number of coins we need

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,420
for the rules, which is the rules times rules plus one over two, then the bullion is based on the

78
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,750
following is greater than or equal the total number of coins that we need or not.

79
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,180
If yes, then true or false observer heroes are long long because rules can be up to two to the hour

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,470
31 minus one, and we would like to multiply that in itself.

81
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,060
So this could overflow overflow in this plus overflow in the multiplication.

82
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,100
That's why I consider those here to belong.

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,190
Long notice.

84
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,490
Let's go back to the search itself.

85
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,070
We know the way in the research you need to start and end.

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,320
Once you are working on functions, you have to decide what is your start and what is your end?

87
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,500
We can see here clearly, maybe we cannot even cover a single rule, so we need from you.

88
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,700
What is the maximum rule that you can have virtually like?

89
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,190
We can use something like and this is a very high about, but then only we can use it.

90
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,250
Maybe you can develop something based on the squirrel in, but we don't care about that.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,930
Or what we need to get is we have a good lower boat and a good boat.

92
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,580
Now we need, as I told you, we have a series of truths then series of forces, and they need to find

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,020
the last to get us through.

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,950
So this is like finding the last occurrence of her internal.

95
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,580
Here is the left and right like usually not change.

96
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,440
It is the middle like usual no change and are the elephant also conditions?

97
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,490
Now, if it is possible to cover?

98
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:27,280
Mid-Year representa that represented that arose if it is possible to cover mid rules using the current

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,070
in the Queen's, then mid isn't uncertain because we managed to cover that they made.

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,930
So answer here is a.

101
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,950
And we are seeking a bigger and bigger answer, so we move to the left side as we did before.

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:51,770
What if we cannot cover like, let's say, we tried, uh, possible function of eight and four rules?

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,940
We cannot do that.

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,490
So there is no answer so far, and we need tools to change our search to be searching only in the range

105
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,510
of zero and the three.

106
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,110
Please take time to read this.

107
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,510
Good to match it with finding the last the threw in an array is exactly the same logic.

108
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,340
Here are two examples to trace them.

109
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,190
For example, if I give you an equal nine.

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,770
Uh.

111
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,600
In equal, 29, sorry, in equal tonight.

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,900
So we start by zero and 29, the median is at 14.

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,430
The sum would be 100 and the five, as you see, we have only 100.

114
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,870
The submission here is very high and we have only 29 going.

115
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,890
So we have to shrink now.

116
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,370
Go to the middle, which is now 13, zero and 13, is generating for us to anyone.

117
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,270
We need 21 coins, but we have to win in nine coins.

118
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,140
So this means that we can at least recover six rules.

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,670
But let's see if we can do better, so we jump to the right interval from seven to 13.

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,020
Now the method is 10 10 rules need 55 coins.

121
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,010
We cannot do that.

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,000
So let's jump to the list to reduce from seven to nine.

123
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,050
The method is eight.

124
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,560
It rules need 36 of coins.

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,530
We cannot do that.

126
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,080
So let's reduce seven and seven is twenty eight coins, which is enough.

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,380
So this way we keep updating their answer here.

128
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,580
I hope the idea of this part is true, but now I would like to take you one more step further.

129
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,140
How can we prove that?

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,730
How can we recognize the general functions for brain research?
