1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,960
It's sort of the lobster problem about what getting the message.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,600
Um, so again, let's think about the brain research about the here.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:17,070
If I told you that using ten seconds, we managed to deliver the message, then definitely using ten

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,330
point five we can deliver.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,500
It was ten pointed.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,710
Like 12 seconds, we can deliver it.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,830
If I told you that six seconds are enough to deliver it, five seconds are enough to deliver it for

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,360
two seconds aren't enough to deliver it.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,580
So this is a one trick function here.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,890
So the possible function is to function.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,550
So this is the first step, which is a stronger signal that we can bind the research at the time.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,210
So we will start here with binary searching on the time the function had the position and the message

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,720
distance.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,050
We bring the researcher at the time the limits are based on the problem fixed.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,200
We can build the middle and we have a possible function.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,710
If it is possible with this middle time, we are happy.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,030
But let's shift to two and equal metal to try to find the minimum time.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,710
If the current time isn't enough or the current distance, time, year, equal distance, if the time

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,280
or the distance isn't enough, then we need to search for a bigger party.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,690
The challenge in this problem is in writing the book about function itself.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,810
So here is the logic, which involves some good amount of thinking.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,460
Now, let's say we have D units of time, which mean we can move distance of D, so the function here

23
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,790
take positions, the message distance and how the selected time were the selected distance.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,860
Now let's say it is the busier person, the first person, the first person has the most distance.

25
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,200
So logically, he will use all of them, so he will use this more distance.

26
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,770
So now he and b zero plus move distance.

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,240
Once he reached this position, he will show the message which can go up to messaging distance, so

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,630
the shouting will go to a new distance, which is b zero plus maximum distance of plus the message of

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,290
distance here.

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,130
So this is the last.

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,010
So this is my last opposition and this is the last position for the message to reach it.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,940
OK, so this are our first two values.

33
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,180
So the B zero can move to here show two here.

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,140
This is what happened in the first tier.

35
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,620
It's time.

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,980
Now we are done with the first person.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,010
Now, at times for the second debate, so it is bizarro.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,930
It is a move busy to move.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,370
It is the shooting.

40
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,470
So here is the message.

41
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,850
The message can be here.

42
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,780
The second person at B.1.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,370
First of all, we would like to know if this person can ever listen to this message or not.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,960
As simple as I can move back to them using them of distance, so I will start to like logically, will

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,200
move back if I found myself, we can move back at least before or equal to the last position for the

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,790
message, then I can hear it.

47
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,940
What if my best is just to go back here?

48
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,010
Then I cannot hear the message.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,940
So no way.

50
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,860
So the first thing is we need to make sure I can hear the message.

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,910
To do that, we need to compare my this my position minus the distance compared to the last position

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,690
for the message.

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,220
If I am greater than it, then I cannot hear the message.

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,600
OK, let's say I can hear the message.

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,290
So here is to be zero and it is location.

56
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,910
And here is the message of distance at, let's say, messages this year.

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,340
And this is me.

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,200
Now we went logically this person to take the message and go as far as possible to the right.

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,520
So here is the point.

60
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,020
The person himself can go in the maximum keys to this direction with that move distance.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,400
But let's say I'm here a position to a and the distance is five so I can go maximum at was five.

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,570
I can go seven here.

63
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,540
So this is my maximum to go to this site.

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,960
But wait, I am limited with where is this message?

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,570
Let's say that this message here is at six.

66
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,400
Then I, although I can go one unit farther than it, I have to stop here.

67
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:42,390
So I am trapped between my best is to be between the minimum of where the message ends and what is my

68
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,350
maximum limit.

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,720
So the logic is followed, which isn't easy and all involved with a good deal of thinking.

70
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:53,610
The logic is as follows We start with the first person and move the distance.

71
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's call that my last opposition.

72
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,980
Now, for every person at last position, his message can be heard from last message of distance.

73
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,680
This is the last position with the message you can be heard.

74
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,030
For the current person, I this is for this person.

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,750
Well, the current the person I the kind of person would a chick if I return it minus distance, am

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,860
I after their loss?

77
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,850
The message opposition?

78
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,520
If yes, then the message end here, but I can go back only to here.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,560
So there is a gap, then no way.

80
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,040
OK, let's assume you can listen to the message.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,090
What would be your logically last position that you can do?

82
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,960
You'd like to go to the right as much as possible because you would like to deliver to the next person.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,850
So there's two limitation.

84
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,040
I can go to the right up to this distance, but I'm also limited with this distance.

85
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,760
The minimum of them would represent my optimal position.

86
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,080
Uh, if we managed to do that, then we can do it.

87
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,950
So the cure of this problem is not in the binary search, but it is in the bush people function.

88
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,110
But um, this question is harder than the previous two.

89
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,780
It's OK that some questions would hurt.

90
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,160
It's totally completely OK.

91
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,060
Take it easy.

92
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,690
Visit back to do list and all of the tips that we provided before.
