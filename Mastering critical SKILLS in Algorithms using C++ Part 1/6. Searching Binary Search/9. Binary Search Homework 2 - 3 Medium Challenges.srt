00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,530
Homework number two in brain research.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:11,590
The first task is we have an array of integers and we also given an integer that represent the threshold.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:19,240
If we have some integer value, we can divide the array by the value integer division where you are

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,910
sealing the values and some of the values in the.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,700
The divisor that you used is valid if the submission is less than or equal to it.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Now what is the turkeys would like to find the smallest, the positive integer that is valid here.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,210
By the way, whenever I skip the limits, I usually mean you shouldn't depend on them.

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,360
Like you might ask what is the maximum number of the items in the tray?

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,830
I just mean, just consider it as big as 1000000.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,630
What is the threshold?

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
Just a big value.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,680
You can almost double check the values in the liquid itself.

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,310
Let me here clarify on an example so that if things are not clear enough, here is the array.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,730
We can divide this array on different values, whatever we need as an integer, but do like a sealing

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,180
division.

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,080
So integer division was saved if we tried to divide this array by one.

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,190
So whatever one is, one one to over one is two five or one is five nine and so on.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,510
Some of the values seventeen is 17 literary classics.

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,220
No, so we cannot divide by one.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,800
Let's try, for example, the visor like put one over four a zero something.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,850
So we set it up to one two over four is zero something set it up to one five or four is one something.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,270
So set it up to two nine over four is two something.

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,200
Set it up to three.

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,980
So all of the values seven is seven.

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,870
Laser equals six.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,860
It's also an invalid device.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,270
Now use five.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,670
When you use five in division, you will have one one one two, which is two that adds five.

29
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,390
So have less than three six five is the smallest, the positive integer that do that.

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,870
So as you see the small value like one, give me like one value, give it a high value.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,210
The next value is four is still high value.

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,840
Five is a bit less value, so you'll find the smallest integer that satisfy that threshold.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,400
This is where the problem means.

34
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,690
Yeah, but there is more examples to make sure that you understand the problem.

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,000
The second problem is a problem for my garden.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,890
We have, uh, we have different flowers, every flower has some bloom day.

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,350
So let's say we have here some flower number one.

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,890
Here is another flower.

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,000
You know, the flower, flower flower and so on.

40
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:45,860
Now.

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,120
After this given Bloom Day, the flower is ready to be used.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,300
Before that, it isn't easy to use.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,020
So we have any flowers and anyone has a day where we can use it now in the garden or the in the in the

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,390
shop.

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
We need to make Emma buckets.

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,120
And it must have gay flowers, but must be a decent one.

47
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,680
So, for example, let's say gay is free.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,420
Then I need to reconsider the flowers.

49
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,800
Maybe this three, maybe this three, maybe this three, whatever.

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,630
If you take it once, you cannot take it anymore.

51
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,880
Now the problem is we need em buckets.

52
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,250
OK, we need them.

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,220
And the problem, they call this one, and they call this key.

54
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:39,580
We need them a box and we would like to see the minimum number of days notice that we are limited with

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,320
their flowers day here.

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,390
So let's see an example here.

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,040
Um, here in this example.

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,030
We have, uh, one two, three four five where fake flowers.

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,200
We would like to create three buckets.

60
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,900
Everyone has only a single flower.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,150
So now let's simulate after day number one, this flower is ready.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,900
After day number two, this flower is ready.

63
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,270
After day number three, this flower is ready from these four to nine.

64
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,380
Nothing is ready.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,870
At day number 10, this one is ready and this one is ready.

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,210
Now we need it three buckets so we can only with three days, which is the minimum number of days to

67
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,450
have booked so that we can create.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,810
Let's see another example.

69
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,650
We need to book it if one of them has three flowers, so the minimum number here is seven, so let's

70
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,540
wait seven days after seven days.

71
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,130
We have here four flowers ready for us and two flowers ready for us.

72
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,980
Now, why is this only give us one?

73
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,980
Give us one one bucket, we need more than that.

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,060
We need, we need to.

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,400
So we would have to wait today, No.

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,780
12 or so that this not now is ready to add a date well on day 12.

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,850
So now we take this three and maybe these three, two and so on.

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,880
So I hope you, I hope now you understand the simulation of the task itself.

79
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:18,020
In the third dusk, we have houses, we have the location of the houses and we have the location of

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:26,210
heaters, and we would like to, uh, cover all of the current houses with the current leaders.

81
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,770
But we need to set their rediscovery of every heater.

82
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:37,020
So see if there is a heater here and the it is one, then it can cover one one, have one element before

83
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,340
and one element after.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,320
It would like to find the minimum radius so that interior use so that we would add to all of the heaters

85
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,720
such that all of the houses are covered.

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,190
Let me give an example.

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
We have here three heaters.

88
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,480
So here is the location at point number one.

89
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,230
One.

90
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,110
There is a house at two, there is another house at three.

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,310
There is a third house and there is one heater here already.

92
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,910
If I use the use of one, then I can cover one unit before and one unit after, which is now covering

93
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,650
all of the houses that you have.

94
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,060
So the minimum wages is what?

95
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,320
In the second, the problem is following, we have four house his house at one, at two, at three,

96
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,800
at four.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
So here is the house is.

98
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,890
And we have two heaters, one heater at one and one heater at four.

99
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Now we would like to cover all of the heaters if we use reduce often this heater will cover one here

100
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,580
and here, so this one nose cover and this heater will cover one here and here.

101
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:53,560
So this heater is covered, as is the case we have here two houses one at House one and one at House

102
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,040
five.

103
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,940
The heater here is at medal at two.

104
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,060
That was the radius of three I can cover three units before, so this one is covered and three units

105
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,350
after this one, no is covered.

106
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,210
So the minimum Regis is three and so on.

107
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,730
In case you don't understand exactly the questions we need, read the text very carefully with the examples.

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,530
As I said earlier, don't wait for me to explain for you what is a problem statement?

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,550
It's actually your role.

110
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,850
I just know some people have weak English skills.

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,830
The immediate the problem and don't get it.

112
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,480
So I'm trying to give more help.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,570
But it is an important skill for you to be able to understand the problem requirements by yourself.
