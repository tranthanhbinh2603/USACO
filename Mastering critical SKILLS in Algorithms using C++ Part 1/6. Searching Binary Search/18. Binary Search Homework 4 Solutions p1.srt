1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,180
Let's solve the homework, the first one is asking for the square root function.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,890
This one is a straightforward.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,930
We will start to use normal brain research.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,000
So remember, what is the target?

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,190
The target is to find the square root.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,050
So the first question is, can we bring the research to that lake, right, if of a square root?

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:29,940
So the point is, if we have a square root, let's say two, then the square value is like four.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,750
If you have a score of three, then this is nine.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,900
If you have the value four, then 16.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,730
So this is an increasing function.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,300
So it seems that clearly we can begin research on the square root itself.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
So he would have the start from the zero and the maximum value.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,230
We can just put a very big, upper bound like the value itself.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,990
Now the normal way loop, the normal method.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,600
Now we have the square root value here.

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,130
The subject is good value.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,840
Now, if we're square with the value itself, let's say you are searching for the square root of 10.

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,940
But now the method is three.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,650
So the first thing is three times three is nine.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,070
So the the current the square, the square root is nine.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,000
The target is 10, as we are less than that.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,310
It means that we should move to a bigger one.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,870
That's why we say if middle times the middle minus the value is less than zero, then we need to go

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,180
slower.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,810
Another way to write it is just middle times.

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,090
The middle is less than the value itself, which means actually we need a bigger middle to do it.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,220
After that, we come back here and if it happens, say, say, we have now the Middle East four.

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,870
So now four times the four would be greater than the target, which is 10.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,650
So we need to shrink the values.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
Now, once you are done with it, the thought would be our target value.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,660
It is good here to add something like one item in a slate to handle any potential positions like maybe

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,340
you give me the input of four.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,350
So the binary search, you will find two, but they actually will find one nine nine nine nine nine

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,650
nine.

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,500
When we add an epsilon, then we are helping that to be converted to some nine.

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,400
Then, as the function is here, we are returning an integer, so it will be casted in a way.

37
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,530
So this only would be the return value.
