1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:07,400
We need now to understand how to prove that a function can be used with a binary search.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,150
Um, try to take five minutes for your time based on what we mentioned and try to think about it.

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,560
The moral of it is as following.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:23,120
We need to be to make sure that the the the baboons, the function can guide the brain research.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,270
Remember when we do a brain research on the array that is sorted, so the middle value in a comparison

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,390
with the target value can tell us should we go to the left or the right?

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,890
If you're like intuitive and in an informal sense, you can see that your function can correctly guide

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,360
you to move to the left or the right.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,450
Then this is definitely can be used in a binary search.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,790
Let's be more specific.

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,940
There are two cases, either the evaluation of the possible function is as following forgiving values

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,850
through true, true, true, true and starting from as false.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,740
There is always false after it.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,480
This is case number one.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,650
The second case is we have faults of all sorts of also faults, and once we have true, we have always

16
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:09,950
true.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,490
So this is the only two possible cases.

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,050
Specifically, these are our virtual array.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,650
These are our virtual array and we are trying to use their answers to guide us.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,280
For example, you might be here searching for their lost true.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,140
So if you're a search here, come to a false value and we need the last true, then we definitely need

22
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,760
to decide.

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,120
OK, we jumped in the research to this true.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,760
That's good, we have an answer, but we need the truth.

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,520
So we start to search in this array to find the lost, the true and so in a very similar way.

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,080
If the search is bunch of forces and then bunch of truths, there would never be another false are here

27
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,580
because, you know, as you see, it is an assorted array.

28
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,400
So when we have a true, true, true, true, then false, false, false, this is a decreasing array.

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,090
If we have false reports of also, then true, true, true, true.

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,520
This is an increasing array.

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,580
So as you see?

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,980
The social space is sorted, it is just this time zeros and ones in a set of values.

33
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,820
That's why it is a virtual array, not array.

34
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,260
You could be searching for whatever you need.

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,860
Maybe you need to search for the first.

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,180
True.

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,160
Maybe you need to search for the last efforts.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,030
It's up to you.

39
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,490
It's in a way an array of just to value zeros and ones.

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,940
Again, go back to your general intuition.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,820
Can we guide the search or not?

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,680
If yes, this is a binary search?

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,920
Now the interesting thing is you just need one or two minutes thinking to decide if this is true or

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,220
not.

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,540
Like, think about the indices we have function, if so, if of zero, if one, if we have to ask yourself

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,320
what is happening?

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,700
Is it always increasing?

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,110
And he is always decreasing, like if this is the case, then yes.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,660
OK, let's up like that.

50
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,810
Let's go back to the orange squeeze.

51
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:10,410
I explain that already in there in that in the bush will function the first moment that you decide the

52
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,750
current coins cannot.

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,400
Cover the coins that we know way too to cover it anymore.

54
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:27,570
For example, if possible, function of eight coins and three rules is true now possible function of

55
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,030
eight coins and four rules is false.

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Definitely possible of eight and five is false and possible of eight and six is false.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,020
Boosters would if any number that is beyond the four is false.

58
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,960
So this is a serious piece of true, true, true.

59
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,910
Once we start with the fools, it's false vaults, false reports of all supports.

60
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,610
So this is how we know the social space can be used to guide their binary.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,090
Not.

62
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,610
Now, going back to the word, the monotonic function, the monotonic function is a function that is

63
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,610
increasing, just increasing or decreasing.

64
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,240
Maybe just increasing, maybe strictly increasing, strictly decreasing.

65
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,160
But it is just one of these things.

66
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,440
So this function just keep increasing.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,070
It is increasing.

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,360
So it's important actually increasing function or decreasing function.

69
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,100
This one decrease decrease decrease.

70
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,680
This one is increasing and decreasing.

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,260
So this isn't when putting this function here.

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,430
If it's like that, then like that this is actually a function of forces.

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,800
Then once it's somewhat untidy, if the function is like that, then like that.

74
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,800
So this is Monacan increasing, then decreasing.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,860
So the good about the monotonic functions.

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,880
They are logically can guide the binary search now in brackets with the NIC to think actually that much,

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,930
you will see that in the homework, that things are and are much less formal than that.

78
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,430
A few examples here.

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,430
Assorted array of duplicate values, it actually a monotonic function, specifically that decreasing.

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,900
Their little that it could function that we developed is increasing monitoring function.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,360
Uh, I mean, they're restricting.

82
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,720
OK, now there is a something that's very useful to remember.

83
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
Let's say you have an array of non-negative values.

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,250
Can you bring the research on that definitely didn't sorted now I committed this disarray.

85
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,230
What's happening there is monotonic, so.

86
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,210
The accumulated array is a internet function, you can their social media and some problems.

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,820
The key is to figure out that you are actually searching based on the accumulation of the rate, which

88
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,420
is I'm an attorney.

89
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:48,310
So this is something that to keep in mind in somebody, you need to merely develop this possible function.

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,790
This is your virtual array, and you should think if this is doable or not.

91
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,830
The miners record is usually two section one section that has their start and the end and the middle

92
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,210
and the call for the possible function.

93
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,620
This is classical and repeated.

94
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,660
The second book is developing the possible function, sometimes the possible function, or this is just

95
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,590
one function and sometimes the possible function is doing some counting or so.

96
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,230
The multiple functions sometimes is actually complex.

97
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,380
This is actually the code of the trick to figure out would that visible function?

98
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,040
To figure out what it is, it's correct and to know how to use it in the overall homework of this section.

99
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,680
We will learn about a lot about different cases for that possible function.

100
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:39,810
Now, as I said during this course, I would be explaining in a and informal way and I would be more

101
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,110
concrete than theoretical because it simply make the course, which is actually hard by itself and easier

102
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,040
learning experience.

103
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,610
I would like to show you, what does it mean to speak in a formal way?

104
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,710
So here is how can we explain the binary search in a formal way?

105
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:03,680
We can say the following Consider a predicate be defined on some order set as brain research is possible

106
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,460
if and only if and then I can use this statement or I can use this statement.

107
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,500
I would like you to take a minute and try to interpret what is the relationship between that and brain

108
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,180
research in an informal way.

109
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,650
So that is what what this statement is saying.

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,340
First of all, Bridget could be just a Boolean function that returns true or false.

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,870
That's it.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,060
Now what does this one say?

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,310
Here it say for all X as it's here, by the way, is just your sister's space.

114
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,800
For example, in the range of creates a problem.

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,190
The social space that has this start and end is it's now built.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,100
X implies if bill fixes through.

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,750
It implies that the boy is truthful all way greater than X, how to interpret that mathematically is

118
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,140
following it sees once you found a true.

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,420
Everyone after this exposition, which are position is also true, which can be said in a different

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,780
way.

121
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,070
If the fix is false, every number before it is false, as you see.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,700
This could be a bit confusing unless you have a good mathematical background and can barely understand

123
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,710
that this equal to this in the courts.

124
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,820
I just told you you need a bunch of zeros followed by ones or a bunch of ones, followed by zeros.

125
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,520
This is an informal description for that.

126
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,110
If you would like to make it formal.

127
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,490
It would be good this way.

128
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,340
It is still good and useful to explain in a formal ways because it make the interpretation easier.

129
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,190
Specifically, it make it more controlled.

130
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,440
Well, when we write an informal description, there might be a lot of questions to clarify the informal

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,980
description.

132
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,420
But the mathematics is much more, uh, much more limited.

133
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,860
This simple, by the way, is just the donut symbol taken in C++.

134
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,480
It would be the not operator.

135
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,720
Now, as I see, it might be tough for the people based on your background if you like mathematics.

136
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,950
This is OK for you.

137
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,570
If you studied the discrete mathematics, you should be very familiar with the symbols.

138
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,350
At least I don't mean that all of the algorithms are written in this way.

139
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,150
They are written in different formal ways.

140
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,970
But this is what we mean by a formal description and informal description if you would like to expose

141
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,920
yourself to a lot of formal descriptions.

142
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,130
You could read from the introduction to algorithms book or the one that named as the salaries.

143
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,590
That's all.
