1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,090
Uh, homework, no food, which many to this to their real values problems.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,540
And the first to probably you will be given, uh, an integer X and you would like to compute their

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,130
square root value of it.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,190
But you just return to their integer about four square of twenty years for something, you just return

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,280
it.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,220
Therefore, we definitely can do that with the normal.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,230
It's the library.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,290
But here you have to use binary search to compute that.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,790
And this is an easy problem.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,840
The second problem isn't from, uh, Likud, I couldn't find good examples at Likud problems.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,970
So this is mainly for from s'posed.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,100
Um, well, lane judge.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,660
Uh, I would add a video for these online jokes.

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,510
Um, this visual mean judges like Likud.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,450
But this time you have to right the main function by yourself and you have to read from the council

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
and write to the council.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,970
Um, anyway, let me explain for you, uh, this is a function that you can implement here.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,120
The function will take a vector of double values which represent some bar.

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,360
You reduce it by here.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,550
And also an integrated for the number of people the idea is following, each boy is a search console

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,740
and each boy has a different ages.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,020
Remember we the the area of a circle is to buy our square, right?

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,230
This is the idea of a circle.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,230
So everybody is a circle and we are given the radius of everybody.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,440
We are a nobody and we have any people.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:41,060
We would like to give them every one of them equally sized a piece from the body.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,150
The beast doesn't have to follow any specific shape.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,480
It could be for any shape, however, and even little pieces, whatever.

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,520
But it must come from a single body.

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,410
It must account from a single buy.

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,200
And there could be some leftovers from your pie.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,270
So again, we have several bodies and we have some people in the body.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,260
Everyone would like to think B will take a piece from one specific bite.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,850
Maybe he will take this piece here, and maybe this person will take this little piece here and maybe

35
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,930
this little piece here.

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:20,930
And then what we hear here is the area of there received from a specific by the total area here for

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,630
this guy would be equally sized.

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,390
Now the question is what is the largest possible besides each person can take?

39
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,070
Let's see an example.

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,560
We have three boys at three.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,570
This are the ridges and we have four persons here.

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,170
So here is how we can solve it here.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,210
The answer is twenty five point something.

44
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,570
This is the largest area of an equally sized piece so that for the beast, no vote for the body.

45
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:47,990
No.

46
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,310
The first body was reduced for the idea of this piece is 50 something.

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,540
So we give this one to two persons, so every one of them take twenty five something here.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,840
And then so then we cover two persons.

49
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,220
We take from this by 25 and from this by twenty five over all five people for four persons are covered

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,150
using twenty five here.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,940
Another one, we have only a single bite of Regis five, and we have 25 person in the scene, so it

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,930
logically we will divide it equally between all of them.

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,410
So the that circle area of fridges for is this value divided by twenty five.

54
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,320
You get this value.

55
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,000
Another case here, if you have all of these resources and six people, so this is answers.

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,040
Now, as I mentioned, uh, a sport in the sport, you have to write me and you have to read from the

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,430
console and write to the console, you got it from fights.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,690
Now if you try to read the description of his book itself, it will be lengthy.

59
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,320
But read it.

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
It will be a good idea.

61
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,990
I shortened it to be good for you.

62
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,000
There is also a trick in the text.

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,630
The trick is they say that the material should be added to the total case.

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,490
So in the text, they would mention 24 Burswood and you had lost one making here.

65
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,890
You would love easier and entering you this trick.

66
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,750
This tricks haven't a lot in competitive programming, and this is okay in computer programming context.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,120
But as an algorithm, because I do not, I don't want to waste your time in such a minor concerns.

68
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:22,980
So, uh, uh, for for a sports, you have to write a mean and read and write.

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,010
And they also retest the cases like you did seven to eight cases.

70
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,230
And this is why it is the case.

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,360
Now I would like to make your life easier, so I did the following I'm providing you with this file.

72
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,410
It is, it says, something like Bush by I think it was 02, yes.

73
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,860
Now this file has the mean ready for you and has the function that I asked you to implement to year

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,660
ready for you to just try to do.

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,500
If you just took this file and filled only this specific function, it would be for more for you more

76
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,140
or less like it could you only and it could all the function.

77
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,620
So you take the template and fill only this function and submit it.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,060
So this is just will be much shorter for you and could be based on the text from the website so that

79
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,300
it still could be herself.

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,770
One concern here we mentioned the minor search we can do.

81
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,420
Why look this way or better?

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,040
It it up to 100 iterations?

83
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,600
This one will fail with this problem responsibly and use this iteration this thing.

84
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,050
OK.

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,360
Another problem, sadly, from Bush, is as following, uh, I tried to simplify the text, it's a bit

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,980
challenging problem to understand.

87
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,870
We have a line.

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,020
And there are many people positioned somewhere in this line.

89
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,880
So the first thing that you think is victor oppositions for the people.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,770
And you have a message of distance.

91
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,010
And our message is if someone here shouted a message, a person who is far like, let's say distance

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,380
of three is far three from you cannot listen to the distance.

93
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,130
So let's say this is better than here at six and this person is at three.

94
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,520
Mm.

95
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,480
Let's make it two and five.

96
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,080
So this person at to the distance of hearing is three, two and three five Callison, yes, if this

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,990
person is at 12 from five to 12 is seven greater than the distance, so he cannot hear, OK, here is

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,290
a it is what's going to happen.

99
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:32,110
The first person will hear the message and we would like to deliver this message to the last person.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,040
So this people in the business as a team will start to arrange it with their positions such that in

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,400
the minimum time we can deliver this message, every person run at a speed of one unit, their second,

102
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,680
which you mean just like one unit in a way like the time is like the distance here.

103
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,460
And he either move to the left or moved to the right.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,320
And from that, he will hear the message and shoot it to the next person.

105
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,290
And we would like the team to committee to collaborate together so that he can deliver the message as

106
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,280
fast as possible.

107
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,550
You would like to find that a minimum time for such a delivery.

108
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,980
The position array is sorted, right?

109
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,580
Let's give an example so that this very generic statements are more clear.

110
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,690
We have two persons only at positions zero.

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,890
And musician, six.

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,920
The message distance is three.

113
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:32,510
So if the first person who showed the message, then the only one at position three can hear it.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,200
This people can arrange themselves in only 1.5 second to deliver the message as fast as possible.

115
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,500
Here is what will happen after rainbow in five seconds.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,610
The first person will move to a location, one being fired in burial.

117
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,660
Two that the last person will move back to 4.5.

118
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,250
Now, the minimum distance is three, if this person is 30 to should this message a that is his three

119
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,430
steps before will be able to hear the message.

120
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,700
So now in all 1.5, I move here.

121
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,810
You move here.

122
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,250
I should the message.

123
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,390
You hear it?

124
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's see.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,550
Another example.

126
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,620
We have someone at position zero.

127
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,770
Another opposition foot and another one, a position four and someone a position eight.

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,040
And the distance for a hearing is only to the optimal for this one would be only one second of time.

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,590
Here's what would happen first, the opposition's zero will move to position one.

130
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,020
So he take one one unit of time.

131
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
Everyone in this one unit of time will decide his location.

132
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,360
So this one might be and also one unit of time go back to position of three.

133
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,550
And this one will go to the right to position five.

134
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,310
And this it will go back here to position seven.

135
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,020
Now for a one to three is just two from three to five is just through from five to seven.

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,600
Is just two.

137
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,420
So this person should the message to this one, will hear it.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,470
Then this one should it immediately.

139
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,220
This one here it that this one should the message immediately.

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,810
This one here it.

141
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,750
Another a few other examples there, the message distance now is 70.

142
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,290
So the first person just should read it right now.

143
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,770
This person is very close.

144
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,420
You will listen to.

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,940
So we do not care about the immediate ones.

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,970
Another example.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,930
We have a person at zero and a person at nine and Blitzen at it.

148
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
So the answer is for this person will go here for you.

149
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,230
It's sorry, will move back.

150
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,380
We'll move forward.

151
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,460
The four year position for this one would remain as a year.

152
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,970
This one would move back here at 14 in four seconds.

153
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,550
So you know, the distance here is five and the distance here is five in just five steps.

154
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,250
Everyone is now connected so we can shoot and propagate directly to the person.

155
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,700
Things can be more like a fraction here if you couldn't get what I am saying.

156
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,690
That's the trick.

157
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,340
It is very annoying problem.

158
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,740
Please go to the website itself.

159
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,580
Read it.

160
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,960
Understand the problem by yourself.

161
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
Again, I'm doing you a favor here.

162
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,410
You can use this template.

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,760
It is ready for you to use to build your own.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Could just the function and read them in.

165
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,590
Feel free to write them by yourself, or at least review my text to learn about it.

166
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,390
Let's hope.
