1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,210
Let's solve the next problem about the boy.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,320
So the first thing is what is the target or what the target?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,370
Oh, what is the area of the slice that everyone would take?

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,370
Let's say that the current area is tiny and it covered the 30 person.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:18,810
OK.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:28,720
Now, if you decided to grow up and use a bigger area, 35, for example, as a as as this area, this

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,760
means less people can take now.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,990
There is a chance, right?

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,420
So maybe still 30, maybe 25 now.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,410
Let's say you decided to use a Bay Area of seven only.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,350
Maybe you can now cover maybe 45 person.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,740
So the moral of that is when you grow up in my area size, the people are decreasing.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,960
This is a monotonic, decreasing function.

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,670
No, this is the easiest part.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,100
Now this means that we can simply bind the research on the boy.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:02,320
So is I started here with the following I started with creating a vector of double.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,200
I named the Etherium and I will trade with the resources for every resource.

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,870
I would create the current idea among all of the current areas.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,010
I'm going to compute the maximum that we have now.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,490
The start of the area to begin their search is zero, but the maximum is the max area that we have.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,300
Now this Dubai in the research, as usual, can be the middle.

22
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,840
Now let's write a function that say, take the current area and tell us the total number of people that

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,100
can eat from this area.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,500
If this to the number of people who can read are greater than or equal the people, then this is a good

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,830
one.

26
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,790
But let's search for a larger piece.

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,170
Otherwise, this isn't enough.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,940
We need to try a smaller piece.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,000
Now the remaining thing is, how can we write the the total number of people who can read for it from

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,960
a specific way?

31
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,990
This is easy.

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,120
We have here the victor of areas and we have a base.

33
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,220
So for every four, everybody would divide it by the number, by the area.

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,930
This will tell us that the total number of visas, for example, let's say the by area is eight.

35
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's say Britain is eight and you would like to divide it two pieces of land to.

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,450
So this means eight over two, we can divide it to four pieces.

37
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,820
He.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,860
One bees to distribute support.

39
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,570
So if we divided about Area eight over two two pieces of land to Area two, then we have people of Forde

40
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,710
who get eat from this one.

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,720
So we trade one by one by one, get the total number of people who would eat from this boy.

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,450
Now add that to eat.

43
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,100
I hope the function is easy for you.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,680
The overall logic of this function is trivial.

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,540
There is nothing magic in this problem.
