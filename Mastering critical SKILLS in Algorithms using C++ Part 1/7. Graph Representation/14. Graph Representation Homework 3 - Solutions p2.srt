1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's solve the second homework about the metrics for.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,750
Um, so let's see, here's um to start to like find an answer of this question.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,050
Let's think about let's build the simple graph here.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:24,510
Maybe node number zero, go to node number one and go to number two and no to number three.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,770
And all of them goes to node number fourth here.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,090
And maybe to the with number five from here.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,030
Now let's build it there, just to see metrics of this metric.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,450
See it.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,830
Um, let's make a small one.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,230
We have six nodes.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,080
One two three four five six.

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,540
Okay.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,090
One.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,510
Two, three or five?

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,700
Six year.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Now let's.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,630
Would that just a symmetric so we know zero go to one two, three zero to one and two and three and

18
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,800
then one two three, all of them go to four one two three, go to four here one two three go to four

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,230
here and four itself go to five.

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,970
Uh, zero one, two three.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:29,900
All of them go to food for itself, go to five, uh, one two three four five Why-Why zero one two three

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,280
four five it should be six rows.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,240
What's wrong here?

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:41,090
Zero one zero two zero three Burfict, now one and Food two and the Food three and the Food Perfect

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,190
Food and the five.

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,820
Yeah, and five.

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,630
Go to that tuna.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
OK, so this is now the The Matrix.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,140
Let's call it em.

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,240
Now who we try to square the matrix empties em.

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,450
As you know, the matrix.

32
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:00,380
You, I and G is a good product between the I threw with the gist column.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:00,890
Great.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,690
So let's index them zero one two three four five and zero one two three four five.

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:16,370
So now let's think about, for example, that sea of zero and the four sea of zero and the four.

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,830
What would be that seizure on for means that the application of the rule number zero, which is this

37
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,980
rule with the code of no food, which is this rule?

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:33,660
So clearly we have zero one one one zero multiply times zero one one one zero.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,730
So when we come out of this together, it will be three.

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,150
So now six, zero and four equals three.

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,290
This is what you will get from the matrix multiplication.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,120
And the logical thinking about it here will be what does he?

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,900
I mean, so N.G. means multiplying the Rule Times column.

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,950
So we've got three now thinking back about the graph in terms of a graph.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,440
What does it mean to have this three here?

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,720
What does it mean in terms of the original graph?

47
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,550
So let's think about them.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,060
What does this one and this one and this one?

49
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,100
So for the first one, this one here means zero one each.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,290
The second one here means one and two one in four three.

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,740
And this one, the coming from this two means zero two and then two fourth.

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,310
And this one coming from here is the three and the three four.

53
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,590
So out of this multiplication ended up with three.

54
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,060
Can you get now?

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,340
What does the values three means?

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,920
The value three is the total number of births consisting of two.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:54,190
It just so here is best 014 is Isobel's 024 is another Earth, and the 3:04 is a third the bath.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,350
Now.

59
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,700
As you see, again, we started by thinking, what is CNG mathematically?

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,840
The eye through both of the this column, OK?

61
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,200
Zero and four, we found the value three investigating the three.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,690
The three values come from this three submissions.

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,180
Each submission is relevant to.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,220
The original graph is an edge and another age, and we can see that all of them start at zero.

65
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,360
All of them in the AT4 and this are the intermediate nodes.

66
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:37,130
So we can see that the metrics in the square represent the number of births between I and G.

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,210
That consist of two images that consist of two edges.

68
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,960
And here's the same logic as I said.

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,660
Now, if you wanted to generalize this idea much more, what is emitters of our key?

70
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,280
Here is the idea.

71
00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:02,240
Let's say we computed Emma Square, which represent the number of edges for four between a square of

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,120
I and G represent the number of edges between I and G of twenty two.

73
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,440
If you try to square em square again, so imma square them in the square.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,570
Now the Senate of zero and for example, two and two and for example, maybe seven.

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,700
Let's say this one has three.

76
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,680
This one has five, which here means that there are three edges from zero to do with Lens two, and

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,490
this one means there are five edges from three to seven of to two.

78
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:42,450
When you multiply, the two values together is fifteen, which means there are fifteen edge if fifteen

79
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,600
birth of length before two from here to from here, for example.

80
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,410
Zero one two is when Beth from here and from here to five seven is another Beth from here.

81
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,490
So Ember two.

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:00,660
The power key is the total number of Beth is between I and G, consisting of key edges.

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,830
If you look to the example in the homework image, the bulletin was completely zeroes y because there

84
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,130
are no births of lines then in the in the graph.

85
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:21,460
Now, the and I still appeared to notice C.I. and I tell us if there is a cycle or even the number of

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,910
cycles iterating from eye to eye of Linthicum.

87
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,750
For example, if you have an edge from zero to one edge from one to two edge from two to zero.

88
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:42,490
This is a simple graph if you try to bauer this matrix to the edge of three that a real four, zero

89
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,290
and zero will have one, which you mean you can go in a cycle of three.

90
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,720
It just to go back to Matrix is you?

91
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,780
Now there is a thing here is that the math is that we are referring to is it symbol or not?

92
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,320
Symbol?

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,790
The idea was following in kiss of directed graph.

94
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,620
If the graph is there, which you mean it doesn't have any cycles, then the best will always be symbol.

95
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,500
Otherwise, and both undirected graph, which is the same logic, exactly, but definitely it will not

96
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,090
have symbol about this.

97
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,270
But in a simple best, it means that the values could repeat in the middle.

98
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:27,250
So for example, if you have an edge zero going to one and one going to zero, then if you build the

99
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,810
metrics of the bulletin, you will have a lot of faith is you would have thought you would have a zero

100
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,650
one zero one zero one zero one two one four up to zero.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,840
So the model that the best would be symbol or not based on cycles, undirected graph or I say it like

102
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,900
because when you have an edge zero one, this by definition means you go to one.

103
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,070
I want to go to zero.

104
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,220
If it is a directed graph, then it depends.

105
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,170
Does it have cycles or not?

106
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,460
The last thing that they would like to say, and this is more for seniors, what if I would like to

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,450
like, I would like to get the number of birth is of utmost to give it just not just the exact ages,

108
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,340
just just at most one.

109
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,890
We can build a matrix modified from there and decency and the compute something like that.

110
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,920
I will leave it for you to think about it.

111
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,380
We were doing that back then in 2007 or so, and there are a lot of things that we can do about metrics

112
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,100
of power, but they are all competitive programming.

113
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,910
Get reps.

114
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,080
Please verify this information.

115
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,840
I am trying to get it back from my memory like I was playing with this stuff back then in 2009, 07

116
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,200
or so.
