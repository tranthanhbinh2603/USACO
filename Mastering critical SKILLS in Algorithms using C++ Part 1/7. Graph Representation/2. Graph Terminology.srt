1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,820
Graph theory field is filled with many, many terminologies.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,600
It is impractical to keep explaining all of them in the beginning because most of them would be just

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,530
confusing for you.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,660
So I selected here a subset of examples that are fit enough to be explained early.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,650
It is OK if you don't get some of the like the concepts now, maybe when you meet it later again, just

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,020
revise it later again.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,000
Uh, again, as we learned so far.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:38,450
Graph is just consisting of V vertices, we call them vertices or we call them nodes and also consisting

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,590
of edges.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,570
So when you think about this graph, we have here six nodes one two three four five six.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,370
Usually, the graph nodes would be actually zero based, but here in this example, they are one be.

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,520
The second thing would be the edges e um.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,770
So we have here one edge here two, three, four five, six and so on.

14
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:06,050
Each is a bit of vertices, so edge is a connection between vertices and in mathematics.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,620
When we say this symbol here, it means that the count.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,680
So the count of V here is just six.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,130
And the count of E is one two three four five six seven seven.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,550
OK.

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,360
Sometimes I would mention something like o e actually.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,820
I mean, all that is itself.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,520
When we have an edge of remote, it would be in some context, we would say that it is a source A. And

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,300
B is a target.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,890
For example, I told you I would like to go from one to node number six.

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,640
So one here is the source and six is the target.

25
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:49,120
And we would like to go from one to six, which is one way this way like thinking that like whenever

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,300
you get lost and need a context, think about computer networks.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,440
One is a machine.

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,010
Five is a machine for an exercise machine or c think Airbus one is an Airbus, five is an airport,

29
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,590
four is an Airbus and six is in Edwards and so on.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,870
So anyway, this is a graph of definition.

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,490
Let's go in more a subdivision.

32
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,880
There are a lot of probabilities that are involved in the graph.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,040
The most important of them is what we call directed graph and undirected graph.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,050
So the word undirected means the issue doesn't have a direction.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,110
It means it is a two way direction.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:32,270
For example, node number four can go to number six and node number six can go to new number four.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,780
Do you know the streets?

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,470
When you are on the streets, you can see like you can see a street that is cars can go in the two direction,

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,540
can go this way and can go this way.

40
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,550
So this is a two way your relationship.

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,920
So this is what we model it here.

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,350
An example in real life would be Facebook friends if Mustafa is a friend of Bilal.

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,420
Bilal is also a friend of Mustafa.

44
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,120
If we have a new one here for Mustafa and another new year for Bilal and we have an edge, it will be

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,250
undirected edge, which means the semantic is working well in both directions.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,750
Mustafa is a friend of BLAT.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,850
Bilal is friend of Mustafa,

48
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,610
another type of Graf's which is much more common than the interactive graph is a directed graph.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,360
In the directed graph, it is only one way direction.

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,550
So you see here in this graph, we say three Arrow two.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,820
So this arrow represented their relationship direction.

52
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,440
It means we can go from three to two, but we cannot go from two to three.

53
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,620
So this arrow direction is this way only.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,700
OK, what if I would like to support both ways for specific nodes?

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,810
We can have something like that.

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,450
Three goes to four and four goes to three.

57
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,660
This is a very edge.

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,050
This is a direct edge.

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,840
These two together allow me to go in both direction.

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,510
So as you see, we can represent undirected graph was a directed graph, but the opposite isn't true.

61
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,300
Like if I would like to make an edge to be undirected or like two ways, I can add another edge here.

62
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:14,000
In terms of like building a graph, if I would like to build this, like if I would like to build it

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,100
is like I told you, this is undirected graph and I would like you to build it.

64
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,430
I will give you seven nodes one two three four five six seven.

65
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,310
So I give you only one edge between four and six.

66
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,710
But here the three four.

67
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,540
I must give you two edges because if one of them is an independent edge.

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,450
So this graph has one two three four five.

69
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,860
This one has five edges.

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,360
This one has seven edges.

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,100
So in terms of programming, you must take seven elements here seven beers as an input.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,410
But for this one, you need only five inputs.

73
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,010
So these two, I must give them independently here.

74
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,710
As an example, if Mustafa follows, is the ad in the Facebook.

75
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,720
Mustafa is a person that is a person.

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,390
Then Mustafa can see the Adbusters.

77
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,030
But the opposite isn't true because Z doesn't necessarily follow Mustafa.

78
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,330
So the semantic here is just one direction.

79
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,190
Maybe Z also would follow Mustafa.

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,520
Maybe?

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,180
Yes, maybe no.

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,820
Yeah, so it can have also fallen support, but this is optional one.

83
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,090
So as you see from a domain to another, it decides, is it directed or undirected graph?

84
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,830
The second concept in graphs is waiting.

85
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Sometimes we don't need to wait on the edge.

86
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,590
Sometimes we need it.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,080
So let's say we have a computer network here and all what we care about it that we need to know that

88
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,280
edge number six, the computer number six, is connected with network number four.

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,770
So it ends up like a zero one case.

90
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,460
Is it?

91
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,740
Does it exist to exist?

92
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,460
Does it exist or not?

93
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,370
We say that this is unweighted graph.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,370
In other contexts, we might need a value, a weed or acoustic on the edge itself.

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,780
For example, if we are modeling Airbus, it doesn't matter.

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,660
Just you tell me that Cairo is connected with a flight with maybe Toronto.

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,580
This by itself isn't important.

98
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,570
I need to know that this cost me $5000.

99
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,020
And this trip cost me $2000.

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,850
This trip cost me $3000.

101
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,190
So in unweighted graph, we in graph, we need to need a weed or a cost or a value.

102
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,800
We can even bet going back to the network.

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,150
Maybe we have here the time that it needs, if what Eric was to go from here to here.

104
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,430
This happened a lot in companies that would like their services to be very fast.

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,590
We need to know how much time does it take for a query to reach from like network number four or service

106
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,230
number four to service number number five?

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,780
So yeah, this way, as you see, sometimes we need weed, sometimes you don't.

108
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,660
If you are modeling your courses dependency, and I would like to say that algorithm scores.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,180
That programming course.

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,830
So algorithm scores depend on a programming course.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,420
So a student shouldn't take algorithm scores without taking a programming course.

112
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,830
So this is dependency.

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,370
We do need it here.

114
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,010
We just need just to know there is a dependency on.

115
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,160
This examples here show what is very common when the value is an edge.

116
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,430
But I would like to tell you that graph something or something is very generic sometimes to the note

117
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,100
itself has a has a has has a value.

118
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,440
We might say that Node six here has value of seventeen, not five here has value of two.

119
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,120
But this isn't the common case.

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,300
The common case is about ages themselves.

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:53,590
Sometimes there are a phenomena where the same two nodes may have multiple edges between them.

122
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,460
For example, the node here four and five.

123
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,620
Let's say that this is airborne modeling and food is Cairo and five is New York.

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
There are two trips here.

125
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,800
One trip was just the two.

126
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,060
And another trip was corsetti.

127
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,180
Maybe this one is in the morning and this one is in the in the in the night.

128
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,590
So sometimes we need this kind of multiple edges between two nodes.

129
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,680
A graph with multiple edges, sometimes we call it multi graph.

130
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,400
What could be really weird is sometimes that these are age from the new itself.

131
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,830
We call it lube or cell volume.

132
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,630
So the loop or loop is when the edge connected the node by itself.

133
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,170
It might look like a weird case for you.

134
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,540
Like, why do we have an idea from a to itself, the domain itself?

135
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,030
We can specify that, for example.

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,500
For example, in social media, like a graph, maybe.

137
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,130
Yeah.

138
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,770
Let's say you are in a social media and you you bought a very nice profile for yourself and then you

139
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,660
made the like on your personal boost.

140
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,690
So it's more or less something between the person.

141
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,640
Like if we would like to know which Burson like, which Ibbotson OK based on the posts.

142
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,340
So we'll find that Mustafa made a liking to his own post.

143
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,680
So it's more or less like Mustafa has a sales loop here.

144
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
Let me give you another example.

145
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,590
Let's say we are in a basement beach, so this is a big here and there are the basement information

146
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,150
like your credit card information.

147
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,550
And let's say here we have a successful beach or a failure beach.

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,660
If basement is succeed, we go to success.

149
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,320
If they meet fail, we get to fail.

150
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,530
But we need if there is a basic error in the bridge itself, we need to stay on the bridge itself.

151
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,540
So for example, let's say you entered your age with the negative value.

152
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,790
We don't need to make it successful.

153
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,670
We can depicted that very, very, very early.

154
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,790
So we say here that this is a silver loop.

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:12,120
If the graph has an edge between every two bit of nodes, every bit of distinct nodes, we see that

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,300
this is a complete graph or a fully connected graph.

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,110
You see here we have one two three four five six seven.

158
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,160
Four, five, six seven.

159
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:28,360
And if it is connected with one two three four five six zero connected with everything in such aircraft

160
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,500
and under two kids, we have a total of in terms of minus one over two inches.

161
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,630
This is a very dense figure that will come back to the audience in a few seconds.

162
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,080
Graf Bath there wanted the bath would be very common during this course, so there's a very important

163
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,950
term.

164
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,580
The bus is a sequence of images that joins the deceased together, for example, in this undirected

165
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,530
graph, one five four six is a graph.

166
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,930
So I write it as follows I write it like a graph of one, five, four and six.

167
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,710
It means that we go from one two six one five, then age five four, then age four to six.

168
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,020
So this is what a graph.

169
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,990
So as you see, there must be an age, for example.

170
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,520
Five four three two one.

171
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,690
Elizabeth.

172
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,620
But one two four six isn't like see one to exist.

173
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,260
Four.

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,420
There is nothing too much between between two and four.

175
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,460
So this isn't the best.

176
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,580
So the best was this must be an age in a very similar way in the in the directed case.

177
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,210
We have a birth from one to three to four.

178
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,420
But we don't have a bus from four to three to one.

179
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,750
We have from four to three, but we then have from four to three to one.

180
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:52,680
So this is what about and it's a very, a very important concept during that graph three sections.

181
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:00,810
There is also what we call a cycle, and a cycle is about the start and end at the same node.

182
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,420
Usually there are no other repeated moves.

183
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,040
So we call it symbol cycle.

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
So let's see here.

185
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:19,450
Here we can say that one two three four five one is a cycle we started and ended at the same note.

186
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,590
So we call this a cycle.

187
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,190
A smaller cycle would be one two five one.

188
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,350
This also is a that's like it.

189
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:38,380
If I if I wrote something like one two five three three one two three five one two three four five one.

190
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,810
Now you see, there are a lot of the locations we call that this is not a symbol cycle.

191
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,530
So if the cycle doesn't have repetition in the middle, we call the symbol cycle.

192
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:57,900
In The Daily Telegraph, in a very similar way we can have we can have cycles like here you see we go

193
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
from three to four.

194
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,540
This is a cycle.

195
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,650
This is the only way I could hear like one to three is in a cycle because there is no energy from two

196
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,580
to three.

197
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,670
If the directed graph doesn't have any cycles, we call it D&amp;G, and that is a very special and very

198
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,570
important case.

199
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:21,770
So directed acyclic graph or the DAG is a graph of the record graph that doesn't have cycles.

200
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,620
That doesn't have psychics.

201
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,270
Another concept is, is a graph connected or not?

202
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,750
When you look through this graph, we notice it is completely connected.

203
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,340
But when you look to this graph, we see it is disconnected.

204
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,590
We have one unit here, one unit here, one unit here, every unit of them is a sub-groups.

205
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,650
In the undirected case, we call it a connected component, a connected component.

206
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,700
Um, this is also we call it a forest here.

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,560
The forest is bunch of separated groups, so sometimes force is more about trees as we'll see.

208
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,010
Spurts and then SIGGRAPH is a very important information.

209
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,800
The Spurs means the graft has relatively few edges.

210
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,270
The density in the group has too much edges.

211
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,730
If it would like to quantify that.

212
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,390
We can say the following a spot SIGGRAPH would be all or we spoke of V this way.

213
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,220
As I said, I didn't.

214
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,600
SIGGRAPH would be obvious where.

215
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,620
This means that the Densey graph is very close to be a complete graph.

216
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,730
OK.

217
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,400
So here are a bunch of examples.

218
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,960
This one is a sports here.

219
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
We have six nodes.

220
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,200
We have seven edges.

221
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,770
Very close.

222
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,700
This one is a sparse also, but this one is dense.

223
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,820
This one is dense because the number of edges are very close to the total number of a complete graph.

224
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,200
So in a way it is.

225
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,460
How can you quantify that?

226
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Why is it important because, well, some algorithms are good for denser graphs, some others are for

227
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,520
sparse graphs.

228
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,190
The new neighbor is a very simple concept, which I mean, simply, what are my neighbors and what is

229
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,090
your neighbor if there is an issue between you and the node itself?

230
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:12,330
So for example, here we see in this undirected graph number three, there are no three has a neighbor

231
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,470
to a neighbor food.

232
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,080
It means that there is an Egyptian 01:57, an aged from three to four and a direct last year.

233
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,390
The Note two has no neighbors.

234
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,860
The two has no neighbors because it doesn't go to anyone.

235
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,350
Meanwhile, no no one here has two neighbors, which are two and three.

236
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:41,000
There is also a very relevant concept here, what we call the new degree, the new degree represents

237
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,300
your number of neighbors.

238
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,050
So in the undirected graph and number three, the degree is to which because we have to do neighbors

239
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,540
now in the directed graph, it's a bit a bit tricky that the our degrees is the same as the concept

240
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,160
of the number of neighbors we established.

241
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:07,470
So for example, here we see that the degree of two is zero, which means it doesn't have any neighbors.

242
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,710
Then degrees represent for a directed graph.

243
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,140
The number of incoming edges, for example, then it to the degree of no.

244
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,140
Two, is two, which means there are two edges that come to node number two.

245
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,980
Then degree of four is one, the degree of one is zero because there are no nodes coming here.

246
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,180
So the degree and our degree is only concept of what directed graph.

247
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,940
That degree means that what's playing out, which is not my number of neighbors, then degree is what?

248
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,750
What's coming in?

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,230
The three is a special case, three is an undirected graph.

250
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,180
And there is there are lots of interesting birds about trees.

251
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,380
First of all, any two vertices are connected by exactly one.

252
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,770
So you see in the number six connected by five here, four here, three here two one one here, that

253
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,260
is only one way to reach a graph.

254
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,900
Another note now there is a question here.

255
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,470
How can I figure out this is a tree you cannot keep counting?

256
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,490
The bat is an easier ways, as following a tree is if there are any nodes, if it will be only in the

257
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,680
minus one edges and it will be all connected.

258
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,160
So look, here we have six nodes and we have five edges.

259
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,090
This is a tree without any further way to verify it.

260
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,560
So how can you verify tree?

261
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,190
It should be.

262
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,900
All of the nodes are connected together.

263
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,570
You should have any news and the minus one edges.

264
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,440
There are two other interesting but burgess about trees.

265
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,130
If you remove any edge, the graph must be disconnected.

266
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Like, let's say you do this one here.

267
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,210
If you remove this one here, then we have one component here and another component here.

268
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,040
Another interesting fact If you connected anyone edge, you could it one cycle.

269
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,690
For example, if we connected the one in six, this is creating here, one cycle here.

270
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,610
A very relevant the concept is rooted tree in a tree.

271
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,170
You take one root from the undirected graph and like, let's say that this was an underrated graph.

272
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,910
You started from five as a root, every edge coming out of it, you make it in the other direction.

273
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,220
It and other direction make it in the other direction.

274
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,460
Then you go to this one every edge you make at other direction, the other direction, every other direction.

275
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,720
So now you see, it's to become rooted as if there are as if there are like a flu in a specific way.

276
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,240
So this is a rotary that is one interesting bit here.

277
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,820
Remember, this is a directed graph.

278
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,140
Um, every node has only one parent in this routing graph.

279
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,990
Every node, if you if you look to the undirected graph, you do know like there is no better and the

280
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,890
concept here, we have just something connected to something in trees.

281
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,480
We have this beer.

282
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,740
And the reason we say that Note5 is the parent of two, not three, so too is the parent of three.

283
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,160
Not one is abilita four.

284
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,410
So it follows the direction.

285
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,700
This is only for three.

286
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,440
The concept of the parent coming from a life like this is the John who is the father of Adam and is

287
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,570
the father of also, um, Maryam.

288
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,090
So we say that John is a parent of Adam and Mary.

289
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,930
So in a very similar way, when you create a rooted tree, it is, uh, it is like there are the parent

290
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,480
concept that then noted that doesn't have any children.

291
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,580
We call them leaves.

292
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,100
So this one Node two has two children, three and six, and six is a child of two.

293
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,810
Six.

294
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,120
It doesn't have any children, so we say three, four six are we call them leaves like a leaf of a tree.

295
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,340
There are different types of fruit, a tree of liberty, every angle for every arrow, for example,

296
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,120
here to the up.

297
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,230
It's also a rooted tree, so after you build it this way, you'll flip it.

298
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,600
Then it's also around the tree.

299
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,340
Sorry for the British boy.

300
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,060
So great theory and very dense in definitions.

301
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,900
It doesn't work for now if you miss some of the concepts that struck.

302
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:13,450
I would like you to know that graph is a data structure because it's a class that is built around its

303
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,500
seeded, around its roads and around its edges.

304
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,410
And we have many algorithms to it.

305
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,190
That's all.
