1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,440
Homework number three, this homework is hard, and remember, I tried to challenge you during this

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,690
course, I can trivially give you like a bunch of easy problems.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,090
You will finish the course you solve with all of them.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,140
You are very happy with your progress and then you'll have to fight the story in the.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,310
And that's it.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,410
During the course, I will challenge you a lot and this is a good thing.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,940
And remember, there will be a lot of moments of frustrations.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,900
Also, remember that I asked you, there are two educational strategies here you can solve the first

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,770
the easy problems during the course in the medium, then the heart may be the first medium and later

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,250
the heart.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,970
If you would like to try the hard, the earlier the course, that's totally OK.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,170
Just understand that your skills are growing up so it will take time.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,630
These two problems are the problems.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,640
The logic behind them is an easy problem.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,410
So take it easy.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,150
Give a trial delay later, but then the to do list or check out the solution.

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:57,910
All of that.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,460
Just be patient.

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,190
So in the first problem, we would like to find the thing in the quiz.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,060
I told you something about that universal thing.

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,730
It should be fine.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,720
They reverse the thing.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,490
So they universities think is a vertex where it's in degree is in the minus one, and it's our degree

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,970
is zero.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,820
In other words, every other node goes directly to this node and this node doesn't go anywhere.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,020
So here node number three, it's our degrees zero.

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,270
It's in degree is all of them goes to it.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,320
So it's in the minus one.

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,090
This is called a universal thing.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,510
So the first thing I would like to use to prove that if there is a universal thing, there will be at

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,740
most one in the graph.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,930
I already wrote the proof in the question.

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,830
So it's simple if you didn't read it or you would like to think about it, that's OK.

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,730
Now here is the challenge that I would like you to write an algorithm which would be open to find the

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,040
the thing the universe.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,160
I think what's more, challenging this problem is you need try to to prove the correctness.

37
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,840
This is one of the problems.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,360
If you try to be very informal, this is there is a good chance that you will miss some decent some

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,990
cases.

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,090
So this isn't an easy problem.

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,400
Maybe the lucky part is if you develop the good, the cases, you will find the failure points of your

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,850
algorithm.

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,590
This is a good thing about this problem.

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,380
So some problems, if you develop enough these two cases, you can figure out the mistakes in your idea.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,290
Anyway, I would like you to try to develop an idea that is in and then prove the correctness believes

46
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,850
assumed that the graph that you are given to the here is an adjacent see matrix return, a zero based

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,320
index for the node, which is the the the thing over minus one if there is no such a thing.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,350
I would like you to develop several cases.

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,600
OK.

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,080
For the program, this program will not read a graph, it will read multiple graphs, so you will read

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,220
first for artistic two cases, this is your first integer three mean three stick.

52
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
It is, and therefore it is the case.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,640
You will have started to read the number of moods and edges and then read the edges.

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,540
So this is the guess.

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,650
What is the key statistic?

56
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,030
Three forever?

57
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,250
It is the case you would bring to their sink.

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,020
So for the first to graph, the thing is three for the second, the graph of the zinc is five.

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,790
For this graph, there is no theme I am providing you with two files.

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,990
One of them find the single edition, but the text for fun sync up with the text.

61
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,600
But it could be missed the content to test your program, but do that after developing your own test.

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,910
The case is an after verifying your code.

63
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,410
There is no problem on that.

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,100
On the internet.

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
I'm not aware of any of them.

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,030
So just see, I'm just trying to help.

67
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,210
I will not always provide them file, but this is a bit tricky problem.

68
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,230
So I wanted to give more help and advice when you are trying to solve hard problems.

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,580
Don't start thinking about finding the optimal solution.

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,670
This is a big mistake.

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,120
The first step in solving the problem is too far to think about the brute force.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Can we can we develop a brute force for this problem or not, for many problems?

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
There is an initial brute force idea the good thing about brute force.

74
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,470
It is easy to get an idea so your mind will start to flow in the problem.

75
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,280
And instead it is.

76
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:26,240
The second point is try to improve the brute force that is maybe like 70 percent the chance you can

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,750
improve your brute force, sometimes you know you cannot, you have to think in a different way.

78
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,680
So try to start writing a brute force version for this problem.

79
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,560
One good thing is you can define function.

80
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,500
Let's say, if a slow and this is a slow, stupid function that definitely will find the thing and then

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,450
develop your first version.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,670
And now you would like to check the correctness of your first the every time you run your code or first.

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,360
Also, you write on slow and compared to Albert, for example, if you're a slow version, say the answer

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,900
is three.

85
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,250
But your first version, say this, it is minus one.

86
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,670
Then my good and fast is wrong.

87
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,730
So the good news you can use the brute force version to verify the correctness of your approach.

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,170
Yeah, that's hot here.

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,820
Now let's move to another problem, which also involves adjacency matrix, not A-list.

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,240
I would like you to assume we have a binary matrix binary adjacency matrix of directed, which is,

91
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,120
for example, matrix of AMG will have value one if there is at least age from AMG.

92
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,190
Now, let's say we computed the square of the matrix like M atoms m here.

93
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,500
The purpose of this assignment.

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,300
I would like to investigate what is this c in terms of the original graph.

95
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,940
So now we have the original matrix here M and then we square it and got a new Matrix C and we have some

96
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,360
graph.

97
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,770
So we know that M is adjacency matrix of this one.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,860
But what is see here, what does it represent?

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,100
If you are done with this one and would like to go bigger than that, what does it mean to power the

100
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,050
matrix up to the power key?

101
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,990
You don't have to write a good year to compute the matrix about just go to any online calculator and

102
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,650
use it to compute.

103
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,910
The Matrix for this assignment isn't about coding, it's about investigating.

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,300
OK, so how to do analysis for such a problem and such a problem, you need to do two things together.

105
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
The first thing is to try to think in a logical way.

106
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,740
Like what, what is the matrix about?

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,240
What does it do, things something like that and try to find observation through that?

108
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,030
The second thing is to try to find patterns like you look to the concrete examples and try to find them.

109
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,720
Some people would just keep thinking in a logical way.

110
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,170
Some people would just keep thinking for the better.

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,390
I believe the two approaches together.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,180
Do some thinking, do some concrete investigations?

113
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,640
Now, another tip when you are investigating a problem, never, ever start with the refugee example,

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,250
like you start, ask yourself, what does it mean to Baremetrics with the one?

115
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,590
This is a military vet.

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,790
What about two nodes?

117
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,890
What about three nodes?

118
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,260
So we know that the symbol is the graph.

119
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,870
A reasonable graph would be achieved.

120
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,860
So what about the chin?

121
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,000
What about three?

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,830
OK, so the point is start start smooth.

123
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,110
Don't just go very large, it would be very hard.

124
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,710
So for example, this is a fight with the opposite that she achieved.

125
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,840
So this is their adjacency matrix.

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,630
Now we bought it, which is a matrix times itself.

127
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,800
And this is the result.

128
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,200
So this is this is see what does a C represent in terms of that?

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,790
Yeah, that's all.
