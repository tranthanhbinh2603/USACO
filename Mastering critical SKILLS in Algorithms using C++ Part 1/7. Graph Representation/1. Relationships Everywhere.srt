00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:08,090
In this section, we start to move to one of the very interesting and very important algorithm's topics.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:15,230
This topic is the graph theory and graph theory is one of the topics that you can actually use in many

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,710
different ways, like you must understand the basics of graph theory.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,740
We use some of it in many different fields, and there are some interaction to some extent in the industry

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,010
too.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,610
So let's, first of all, motive that we can't see.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,310
There are too many relationships everywhere.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,780
Let's give a lot of examples.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,170
But let me first say in a in a nutshell, what is a graph theory?

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,800
The graph theory is all about the following We can see that there are many things that involve some,

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
be it wise, relationships between objects.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,690
So what is an object?

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,310
Anything can be an object.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,670
I don't hear and I don't hear, mean, an object oriented programming.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,590
I mean, the English keyword, for example, let's say we have a city and this city has six internet

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,220
airports.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,200
And there are flights between them.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,920
Let's, for example, no the airports from one to six.

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,060
Now this here is there is there is a diagram that we can draw by hand and we can easily understand.

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,310
So let's say this is a New York airport.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,340
This is maybe New York Seattle airport, whatever.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,710
Some six, some six airports here.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,590
Now, as you see, there's some flight from Airport one to Edgewood five.

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,230
There is some flight also from airport one to airport two and so on.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,860
So the airport here is what we call an object.

26
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,580
The Bitwise relationship is the connection between them.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,490
So this is, in theory, a graph theory.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,490
Let's go in and actual examples and go back to that.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,400
So here is Google Maps and Google Maps.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,710
You would like to go from a place to another.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,100
There are a lot of data here, a lot of details, and there are even constraints like what time to do

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,220
the trip, what did what, what, what kind of transportation?

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,500
A lot of things you see.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,670
We have locations.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,360
We have some birth is between them, the social media.

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,590
When you think about the social media, there are a lot of people on social media.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,380
The person here is the object himself.

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,090
And if you are a friend with someone, then this is a relationship.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,330
There could be also some bridges that you like, some videos that you watch.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,710
And all of such relationships and the media.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,750
So you see objects.

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,040
Connections.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,510
Even sometimes things could be very weird from your perspective, like thinking about circuit connections

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:38,840
here.

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,140
There are here boons and connections between them, grammar in English.

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,190
Even such a statement can be split into such a tree where we are building the expression values level

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,710
by level.

48
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,660
So it seems like, again, points connections between them.

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,420
And biology, the molecular, you can see also, it's eventually bunch of boys and connections between

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,640
them computer networks, it is very clear we have a network in our university.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,920
There are a lot of machines.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,310
They are connected together.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,380
There is some direct connections.

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,470
I can reach this machine by going through maybe two or two other machines, but we are connected.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:28,540
So the object here is the computer network and that links the the wire links are the connections, the

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,530
search engines.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,270
When you access a webpage, this would be you could have links to other webpages.

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,030
That bridge rank is a very important algorithm used by search engines like Google.

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,000
So bridges here are connected with each other.

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,920
Let's move to a computer vision field in the computer vision field.

61
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,250
There is a problem with Google, but the booze estimation estimation.

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:58,060
So this is a person, and we would like to identify specific say it in joints that represented a person

63
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,620
like the head, the neck, the shoulders left and right, head left and right, and so on.

64
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,950
So when you think about this joints and the relationships, they actually represent objects, which

65
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,910
is here adjoint and the edges between them, the connections between them.

66
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,750
An object to tracking, which is also part of the computer vision field.

67
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,730
We have a video and there are a bunch of people in the video, so the same person, we see him in a

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,300
frame.

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,930
Then after a few seconds, we see him in another frame.

70
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,430
So we'd like to know, is this a bit implicit implicit relationship?

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,700
This person would be connected with the same person.

72
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,050
After a few frames, robotics also this joins can be represented as points and as connections.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,950
See, transition diagrams, transition, Graham, describe the behavior of a system like, for example,

74
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,560
we have a process and this process with an event can move to another process and so on.

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,130
And this is a diagram that represent the people like you start as a board, as a child at this age,

76
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,130
you move to adult age, you move to that and so on.

77
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,660
So we can represented a different state so that we as a humans here, as an object, as a states.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,890
And then we connected them based on some connection.

79
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,280
It's totally OK if you don't get most of these examples, that's totally OK.

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,580
I just wanted to highlight how graphs are everywhere.

81
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,780
And if you thought about what is common between all of these things, the government is we have objects

82
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,620
and we have relationships and social media or Facebook people would be the objects or even images in

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,210
internet work.

84
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,820
The computer would be the objects in a body person.

85
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,290
The joints would be the objects.

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,650
And there are relationships between beer of objects here.

87
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,220
So as you see, the relationships and graphs are everywhere.

88
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,300
If you try to draw your family like you, your beer and his beer and your grandparents, your child

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,930
and so on.

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,120
This represent such kind of objects and relationships.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,980
Now, if I asked you that this problem or many other problems, you start to think, OK, we have a

92
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,840
network of six computers, 10 links, and it would like to know, for example, if this machine can

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,800
see this machine or not lakes through some some intermediate machines.

94
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,490
In practice, it isn't.

95
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,130
It isn't practical to keep working on every problem by itself.

96
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,840
We do what we call abstraction.

97
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,350
We think the problem itself convert converted to a bunch of objects and relationships.

98
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,180
We call this shape a graph.

99
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,390
We call all of these circles nodes or vertices.

100
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,880
We call the connections between them edges.

101
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,490
A graph is set of nodes and set of edges.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,370
So all of the problems I have been explaining can be eventually abstracted to a graph.

103
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:55,150
The good news is I can develop the specific algorithm on graph theory and just the standard that is

104
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,170
ready in my library and whatever domain I converted to graph and use it.

105
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,480
So this is a concrete, real life example.

106
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,430
This is an abstract concept.

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,350
Graphic representation, as I said, all about objects and their relationships.

108
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,240
So when we abstract a domain, we we would try to count the number of objects.

109
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,450
These are my notes like here six airports are six nodes and then the relationships are between.

110
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,550
The objects are directly edges here.

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,060
Now I can work and do many algorithms on the graph.

112
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,100
For example, one might ask in how many ways I can go from node one to three.

113
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Assuming Node one, for example, is a computer is another computer.

114
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,870
I can go in many ways.

115
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:45,020
I can go from computer one to computer to to computer three or one two five four three or one five four

116
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,840
three or one five two three.

117
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,800
This is pretty good.

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,490
Like, let's say the computer five got shut down for a reason or another.

119
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,110
We still can go to three through another computer.

120
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,500
But in practice, we implemented this as a a separate utility.

121
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,470
So this is one one question.

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,270
Another question might be what is the shortest Abarth?

123
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,500
From Node one to three, the shortest Abarth has many definition.

124
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,030
It should be shortest Abarth.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,680
A one of them here could be in the number of edges to reach it and would, for example, the best one

126
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,370
five four three takes the three edges.

127
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,030
The best one five two three takes three edges.

128
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,820
The best one two three takes only two edges.

129
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,560
So this way I introduce for you two to three problems in graph theory.

130
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,500
How many baths is between two nodes?

131
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,190
What is the shortest bath between and then another?

132
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,700
And as I mentioned, eventually we abstracted the domain to the graph and do our algorithms on the graph

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,060
itself.

134
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,180
During the course, we would mainly focus on the graph path itself, but in real life, we have a domain

135
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,180
that we convert first to a graph like in Google Maps example.

136
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,380
That's all.
