1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,620
In this section, we would like to start to learn more about how to represent the epigraph as the section

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,660
is graph representation.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,730
We would like to represent a graph.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,650
For a while, it might seems like a very difficult task.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,800
How can we take such a graph and express it in computers in something?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,750
However, it isn't by the end of the this citizens and their homework, so you will be very flexible

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,920
when it comes to graphs.

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:35,090
I would like you to take two minutes and ask yourself a simple question How can I express a graph with

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,720
five nodes like that in a matrix that is five times five?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,520
Like, you have a five times five metrics?

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,300
I would like to encode this kind of information inside this five times five metrics.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,330
How can you do that?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,160
This is a directed graph.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,130
As you see, the most thinking should be more than enough.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:07,260
The idea is very simple we can create a matrix such that, uh, if the matrix of Ingwe represent how

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,630
many edges we have from node ideology as there are no multiple edges here.

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,070
So this means every two nodes will have either zero edges or one edges.

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,460
So let's see here node number one and number four, there is an edge between them, so node number one

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,530
and node number four here.

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,340
Should have I won here?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,670
What else?

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,900
Two and the three, so array of two and the three should have won here one and two.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,030
One and two should have won here.

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,100
A ray of zero and two should have won, so zero and two should have won here.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,310
So as you see, this is very simple and very intuitive, right?

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,910
Like, you just put the metrics of high energy or the gratify energy with how many, just how many edges.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:00,470
So this way we can even like if I told you that, maybe let's say, from two to three, like, for example,

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,440
if I said that we have another edge this way and another edge this way.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,360
So now from two to three, we should have here three three edges.

30
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,230
So in this way, we build a very nice mattress.

31
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,310
So the wood adjacency that you just referred to two things who are adjacent, like when we have EMV,

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
this is a different relationship.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,640
The what the metrics mean, just we use a 2D array to express their relationships.

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,970
This is one way and this is very intuitive.

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,640
So let's keep going.

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,840
If the graph is undirected, then one is connected with zero and also zero is connected with one.

37
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,010
So 200 that all what we need to make sure that matrix of energy is as simple as metrics of journey.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,670
For example, if there are seven edges between one and five, the metrics of one five a matrix of five

39
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,620
on one should have a value of seven.

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,490
This usually would create a kind of symmetry in the matrix.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,060
As you see, again, there are no multiple edges here.

42
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,780
So this is a completely binary matrix.

43
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:17,550
If I told you that between one and two, there are four undirected edges.

44
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,550
So one and two, one and two we should have here.

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,360
Four.

46
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,150
So again, so as I see the The Matrix, a 2D matrix is very flexible.

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,560
Either you would like to represent a directed graph or undirected graph.

48
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,110
Now, let's try to implement that, you would you will usually make a typedef and call it graph so we

49
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,820
can use a vector vector of integer to represent the graph so that it be flexible in the creation.

50
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,130
I would like you to create two function, one ad directed edge and one is add undirected edge, which

51
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,470
you take.

52
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,990
The from A to Z are zero based indices like the whole course most of the time, and the graph itself

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,430
that the graph is would be initialized and proper for you.

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,050
For example, if the number of modes is five, graph will be a 2D vector, that's five times five.

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,420
How can we implement these two methods?

56
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,190
But it's take five minutes to implement them.

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,190
Then presentation is very straightforward.

58
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,210
If you have in the directed function, if you have an image from from to you just go to grab from and

59
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,740
to and right plus equals one.

60
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,940
So the second one will will increase the count of the adjacency in the ad undirected graph.

61
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,650
You can go two from and two and read Blitz equals one.

62
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,100
And from the to and from AndroidPolice equal one.

63
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,000
So this way we are adding in the two sides in the same time.

64
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,480
So as you see overall, very, very, very straightforward.

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,340
Now let's use them.

66
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,320
It is how you will write a code that will like take an emblem from the user.

67
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,620
You start by reading the number of nodes.

68
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,990
And number of edges, as we would like to create a matrix of nodes.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,480
The times inwards we create here a graph which is victor victor of nodes, and every entry is vector

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
of integer of nodes.

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,220
I assume that you are good enough in each state to understand this line of code, and then we iterate

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,870
on the number of edges every time we read the form and two.

73
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,610
This is a directed graph, so I'm quoting here the ad directed graph function, which you take the graph

74
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,200
graph from a tool and then we are going to print adjacency metrics to verify it.

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,040
So here is the inputs five nodes, eight edges.

76
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,540
Then we have eight lines.

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,360
Every line is two numbers that are zero based.

78
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,450
If we try to help with this one, it will say from zero to one, there are two edges because you can

79
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,090
see here we have a zero one here and we have zero one here.

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,520
From one to two, we have one edge from four to three, we have three edges four two three four two

81
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,840
three four two three.

82
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,310
How can we write the Brent adjacency matrix to Brent this could here?

83
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,920
Can you try?

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,250
The idea is very simple, but we have nodes, so we iterate on the first look like a tourist that loops

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,690
each one of them go afterwards.

86
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm getting the first one from and the second one to have graphs from and to greater than zero.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,370
It means there are idiocy and from from it to say Brent from and Brent two and Brent a graph of from

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,810
into that simple.

89
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,590
OK.

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,720
What about the wicked graph?

91
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,420
If the graph no has weights with the current metrics would be enough.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,120
How can we change it or how can we handle that?

93
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,950
The idea is very simple.

94
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,050
Let the adjacency of Iron G equal costs, but it didn't.

95
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,830
For now, there are no multireligious OK, like this is just one inch here.

96
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,230
So here I would.

97
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,170
As you see, we have aged from zero to one here.

98
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,370
One and two was 15.

99
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,040
So you go one and two and what 15?

100
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,350
We have from two to four with 13.

101
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,370
You go from two to four here and 13 and so on.

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,710
Can you adjust the previous cuts?

103
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,840
Here is that just good?

104
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,470
We take Froman, too, and we take the cost to now hear from Graph from until we write the costs and

105
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,610
directed one graph from an to equal graph tool from equal the cost.

106
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,860
The reading is the same, almost.

107
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,180
You just read the cost, the here.

108
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,860
Read it here.

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,530
Best to you.

110
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,960
That's all.

111
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,280
So as you see, changing the good is very straightforward.

112
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,140
And here is the outfit.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,900
Now, you might wonder, what should we do if we have multiple ages?

114
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:48,370
If the previous one, we assume two things, we assume that an all ages and also we assume that no age

115
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,050
would have a value equal zeal.

116
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,660
I assumed all of which equal greater than zero.

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,580
However, what of the which between the two two is actually zero or even negative value in the previous

118
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,710
good will depend on the cheek of matt and equivocal zero two.

119
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,800
There is an agent.

120
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,230
But what if it can be used one in a way, the handling of the multiple ages with which in reality depends

121
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,280
on the problem itself?

122
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,710
Let me give you some examples in a suit.

123
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,760
This to bethe problem.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,250
How can we handle the multiple ages?

125
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,980
If you are, if you have interest only in the shortest about, and I told you that not one good to note

126
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,120
event was ghostwritten and good to note seven was close to 20.

127
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,860
Which one do you care about them?

128
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,260
Only the 10 because you would like to get the shots, the birth right, so we can suggest that the minimum

129
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,330
among all of the different ages.

130
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,320
And that's it.

131
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,650
So this is how we can handle multiple ages.

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,850
What about missing values?

133
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,620
One way, maybe just create another Boolean metrics that say, if there is an issue from here to here

134
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,040
or not.

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,940
So now we have the metrics for the Boolean and in other metrics for the values.

136
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,180
Maybe a third way you would initialize their tricks to have a very large value like an infinity, maybe

137
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,410
one each with nine, for example, and then you can convert against Guinness 08:40 and see if that is

138
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,190
a value or not.

139
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:10,150
So two that, you know, missing the key message here there is no standard and what a specific way it

140
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,300
is all about the problem, and you utilise your problem solving skills to come up with the proper representation.

141
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,870
So, so don't be stuck in a specific way through the course you should find in a way.

142
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,760
Examples of that handle such such cases before ending it is very important to understand the space and

143
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,590
time complexity.

144
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,310
So there are a bunch of questions for you.

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
What is the space complexity?

146
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,610
What is the time complexity?

147
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,230
But for the following scenarios.

148
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,220
So I would like to know if there is an issue between you and you and V. What's the name complexity of

149
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,520
that?

150
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,670
If you'd like to get your neighbors, what is the complexity that we would like to bring to the wood

151
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,030
graph?

152
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,200
Let's them complex of that.

153
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,460
And is this representation good for the Spurs audience metrics?

154
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,030
And what does it mean if the two metrics are there?

155
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,760
They are going to has some one zero values, but is it?

156
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,020
Stop the video for like a five minutes and answer out of this question.

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,150
Try to make it a of engagement and trying to make the calls involving a lot of engagement.

158
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm asking you a lot of questions.

159
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm encouraging you to curate algorithm scores, if you would.

160
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,610
So try to help me to make it an easy experience for you.

161
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,180
Here are the.

162
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,580
First of all, we created a 2D matrix of times of each.

163
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,420
So be square in the standard books that they were rated this way all.

164
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,670
Oh, the squid, OK, when I write it this way, I'm just writing it for short because sometimes I use

165
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,790
V and mean the number of notes, and sometimes I use it to mean the set of the.

166
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,410
So just flexibility.

167
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,620
But don't get confused if you'd like to know if there's an edge between you and V, you can do that

168
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,960
in all one by accessing the metrics directly.

169
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,860
If you'd like to get your neighbors, you have to iterate on your route.

170
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,840
Like, let's say this is true.

171
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,750
Number three, and there is someone here, and maybe there is some five here, so you need to iterate

172
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,080
on the wood rule to know that this is my neighbor and this is my neighbor.

173
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,770
So we need all of you to iterate on the road to get my neighbors.

174
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,590
To traverse that graph.

175
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,670
You need to trade on all of the rules and all of the columns.

176
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,960
So this is v squared now thinking about sports and dance?

177
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,830
If you thought about it, this one is very good.

178
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:27,070
If the graph is very, very complete, like if we have every kind of connection, this is very perfect.

179
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,260
The graph, because we have here, we can represent all of them.

180
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,980
We can put them.

181
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,200
So it's actually very good for denser graph.

182
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,090
Now think about the graph.

183
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,310
If I told you have a tree, you remember the tree.

184
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,930
The tree has, uh, any nodes and in the minus one edges, imagine that we have 1000 nodes, so we have

185
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,910
around nine nine nine inches.

186
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:53,090
You created one million entries, total the around 1000 of them or 2000 of them.

187
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,800
This is too much.

188
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,130
So this representation is good for dense a graph.

189
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,990
Not for the specific.

190
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,510
The last thing is, what does it mean to have a value in the diagonal?

191
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,510
Like, let's say we have here are three times the three metrics.

192
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,850
And I found zero zero seven zero.

193
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:21,000
So here in the diagonal, it means that metrics of two and two is seven.

194
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,310
There are seven loops that are around the Pixel two.

195
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,150
That's of.
